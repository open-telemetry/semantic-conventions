# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

Semantic conventions in OpenTelemetry are organized into distinct areas,
with each area being overseen by a Special Interest Group (SIG). A SIG is
composed of multidisciplinary contributors who bring expertise in both the
relevant domain and OpenTelemetry itself.

SIGs have several responsibilities and goals, but their primary focus is to
define and guide semantic conventions toward stabilization. They are also tasked
with the long-term maintenance of these conventions, serving as domain experts
for pull request (PR) reviews and issue triage.

This document provides an overview of all SIGs involved in the
semantic conventions project. In particular, the table below highlights
the owners of each SIG and their current status.

To learn more about SIGs for example, how to kick-start a new one, see the
[Project management document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/project-management.md).
