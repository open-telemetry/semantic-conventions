# Semantic conventions for Connect RPC

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Connect](https://connectrpc.com/) extend and override the [RPC spans](rpc-spans.md) and [RPC metrics](rpc-metrics.md) Semantic Conventions
that describe common RPC operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

## Client Span

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

`rpc.system` MUST be set to `"connect_rpc"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time.**

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [1] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`rpc.connect_rpc.error_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | The [error codes](https://connectrpc.com//docs/protocol/#error-codes) of the Connect request. Error codes are always string values. | `cancelled`; `unknown`; `invalid_argument` | `Conditionally Required` if available. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | int | Server port number. [2] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` [3] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [4] | `tcp`; `udp` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | [OSI network layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [5] | `ipv4`; `ipv6` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective. [6] | `exampleMethod` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. [7] | `myservice.EchoService` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string[] | Connect request metadata, `<key>` being the normalized Connect Metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values. [8] | `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string[] | Connect response metadata, `<key>` being the normalized Connect Metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values. [9] | `["attribute_value"]` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[2] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[3] `server.port`:** if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[4] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[5] `network.type`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[7] `rpc.service`:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

**[8] `rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`

**[9] `rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all response metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `"attribute_value"` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["attribute_value"]`
