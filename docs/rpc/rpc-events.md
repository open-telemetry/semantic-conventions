# Semantic conventions for RPC events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines events applicable in the context of remote procedure calls.

## Message event

<!-- semconv event.rpc.message -->

The event name MUST be `rpc.message`.

Describes a message sent or received within the context of an RPC call.

In the lifetime of an RPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on client and server spans SHOULD be created. In case of unary calls only one sent and one received message will be recorded for both client and server spans.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`rpc.message.compressed_size`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | int | Compressed size of the message in bytes. | |
| [`rpc.message.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | int | MUST be calculated as two different counters starting from `1` one for sent messages and one for received message. [1] | |
| [`rpc.message.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Whether this is a received or sent message. | `SENT`; `RECEIVED` |
| [`rpc.message.uncompressed_size`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | int | Uncompressed size of the message in bytes. | |

**[1] `rpc.message.id`:** This way we guarantee that the values will be consistent between different implementations.

---

`rpc.message.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RECEIVED` | received | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `SENT` | sent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
