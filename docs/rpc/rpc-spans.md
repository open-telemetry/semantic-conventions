# Semantic conventions for RPC spans

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines how to describe remote procedure calls
(also called "remote method invocations" / "RMI") with spans.

> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the RPC conventions that they emit by
>   default in their existing major version. Conventions include (but are not
>   limited to) attributes, metric and span names, and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in their existing major version as a comma-separated list of category-specific values
>   (e.g., http, databases, rpc). The list of values includes:
>   * `rpc` - emit the stable RPC conventions, and stop emitting
>     the experimental RPC conventions that the instrumentation emitted
>     previously.
>   * `rpc/dup` - emit both the experimental and stable RPC conventions,
>     allowing for a phased rollout of the stable semantic conventions.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental RPC conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `rpc/dup` has higher precedence than `rpc` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) their existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * MAY drop the environment variable in their next major version and emit only
>   the stable RPC conventions.

## Common remote procedure call conventions

### Span name

RPC spans MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.53.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

The *span name* SHOULD be `{rpc.method}` if it is available and not set to
`_OTHER`.

If `rpc.method` is unavailable or set to `_OTHER`, the span name SHOULD be
`{rpc.system.name}`.

Semantic conventions for individual RPC systems MAY specify different span name
format.

### RPC client span

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

RPC client spans SHOULD cover the entire client-side lifecycle of an RPC,
starting when the RPC is initiated and ending when the response is received
or the RPC is terminated due to an error or cancellation.

For streaming RPCs, the span covers the full lifetime of the request and/or
response streams until they are closed or terminated.

If a transient issue happened and was retried within this RPC, the corresponding
span SHOULD cover the duration of the logical call with all retries.

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
document for details on how to record span status.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |

[2] | `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `-32602` |
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` if available. | string | The fully-qualified logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective. [3] | `com.example.ExampleService/exampleMethod`; `EchoService/Echo`; `_OTHER` |
| [`rpc.method_original`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if it's different than `rpc.method`. | string | The original name of the method used by the client. | `com.myservice.EchoService/catchAll`; `com.myservice.EchoService/unknownMethod`; `InvalidMethod` |
| [`rpc.response.status_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` if available. | string | Status code of the RPC returned by the RPC server or generated by the client [4] | `OK`; `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`; `-32602` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [5] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` [6] | int | Server port number. [7] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [8] | `http` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [9] | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [10] | `tcp`; `udp` |

**[1] `rpc.system.name`:** The client and server RPC systems may differ for the same RPC interaction. For example, a client may use Apache Dubbo or Connect RPC to communicate with a server that uses gRPC since both protocols provide compatibility with gRPC.

**[2] `error.type`:** If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
`error.type`.

**[3] `rpc.method`:** The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
the original method value.

If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
`_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
RPC methods.

The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
method/function.
The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
RPC client stub method on the client side.

**[4] `rpc.response.status_code`:** Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual RPC frameworks SHOULD document what `rpc.response.status_code` means in the context of that system and which values are considered to represent errors.

**[5] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[6] `server.port`:** if `server.address` is set and if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[9] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[10] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md)
* [`rpc.system.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

### Distinction from HTTP spans

HTTP calls can generally be represented using just [HTTP spans](/docs/http/http-spans.md).
If they address a particular remote service and method known to the caller, i.e., when it is a remote procedure call transported over HTTP, the `rpc.*` attributes might be added additionally on that span, or in a separate RPC span that is a parent of the transporting HTTP call.
Note that *method* in this context is about the called remote procedure and *not* the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.).
