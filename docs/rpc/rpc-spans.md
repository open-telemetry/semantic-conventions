(also called "remote method invocations" / "RMI") with spans.

>   The only values defined so far are:
>   * `http` - emit the new, stable networking conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental networking conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `http/dup` - emit both the old and the stable networking conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental networking conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `http/dup` has higher precedence than `http` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.

## Common remote procedure call conventions

A remote procedure calls is described by two separate spans, one on the client-side and one on the server-side.

For outgoing requests, the `SpanKind` MUST be set to `CLIENT` and for incoming requests to `SERVER`.

Remote procedure calls can only be represented with these semantic conventions, when the names of the called service and method are known and available.

### Span name

The *span name* MUST be the full RPC method name formatted as:

```
$package.$service/$method
```

(where $service MUST NOT contain dots and $method MUST NOT contain slashes)

If there is no package name or if it is unknown, the `$package.` part (including the period) is omitted.

Examples of span names:

- `grpc.test.EchoService/Echo`
- `com.example.ExampleRmiService/exampleMethod`
- `MyCalcService.Calculator/Add` reported by the server and
  `MyServiceReference.ICalculator/Add` reported by the client for .NET WCF calls
- `MyServiceWithNoPackage/theMethod`

### Service name

On the server process receiving and handling the remote procedure call, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not necessarily have to match the [`service.name`][] resource attribute.
One process can expose multiple RPC endpoints and thus have multiple RPC service names. From a deployment perspective, as expressed by the `service.*` resource attributes, it will be treated as one deployed service with one `service.name`.
Likewise, on clients sending RPC requests to a server, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not have to match the [`peer.service`][] span attribute.

As an example, given a process deployed as `QuoteService`, this would be the name that goes into the `service.name` resource attribute which applies to the entire process.
This process could expose two RPC endpoints, one called `CurrencyQuotes` (= `rpc.service`) with a method called `getMeanRate` (= `rpc.method`) and the other endpoint called `StockQuotes`  (= `rpc.service`) with two methods `getCurrentBid` and `getLastClose` (= `rpc.method`).
In this example, spans representing client request should have their `peer.service` attribute set to `QuoteService` as well to match the server's `service.name` resource attribute.
Generally, a user SHOULD NOT set `peer.service` to a fully qualified RPC service name.

**[1]:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[2]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[3]:** if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[4]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[5]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6]:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[7]:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).



`network.transport` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

### Events

In the lifetime of an RPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on
client and server spans SHOULD be created. In case of unary calls only one sent
and one received message will be recorded for both client and server spans.

<!-- semconv rpc.message(full) -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

The event name MUST be `rpc.message`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.message.compressed_size`](/docs/attributes-registry/rpc.md) | int | Compressed size of the message in bytes. |  | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/rpc.md) | int | MUST be calculated as two different counters starting from `1` one for sent messages and one for received message. [1] |  | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/rpc.md) | string | Whether this is a received or sent message. | `SENT`; `RECEIVED` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.uncompressed_size`](/docs/attributes-registry/rpc.md) | int | Uncompressed size of the message in bytes. |  | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** This way we guarantee that the values will be consistent between different implementations.



`rpc.message.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

### Distinction from HTTP spans

HTTP calls can generally be represented using just [HTTP spans](/docs/http/http-spans.md).
If they address a particular remote service and method known to the caller, i.e., when it is a remote procedure call transported over HTTP, the `rpc.*` attributes might be added additionally on that span, or in a separate RPC span that is a parent of the transporting HTTP call.
Note that *method* in this context is about the called remote procedure and *not* the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.).

## Semantic Conventions for specific RPC technologies

More specific Semantic Conventions are defined for the following RPC technologies:

* [Connect](connect-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *Connect RPC*.
* [gRPC](grpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *gRPC*.
* [JSON-RPC](json-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *JSON-RPC*.
