# Semantic conventions for RPC spans

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

> **Warning**
> Existing RPC instrumentations that are using
> [v1.37.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.37.0/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md)
> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the RPC conventions that they emit by
>   default in their existing major version. Conventions include (but are not
>   limited to) attributes, metric and span names, and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in their existing major version as a comma-separated list of category-specific values
>   (e.g., http, databases, rpc). The list of values includes:
>   * `rpc` - emit the stable RPC conventions, and stop emitting
>     the experimental RPC conventions that the instrumentation emitted
>     previously.
>   * `rpc/dup` - emit both the experimental and stable RPC conventions,
>     allowing for a phased rollout of the stable semantic conventions.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental RPC conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `rpc/dup` has higher precedence than `rpc` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) their existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * MAY drop the environment variable in their next major version and emit only
>   the stable RPC conventions.

## Common remote procedure call conventions

### Span name

The *span name* MUST be the full RPC method name formatted as:

```
$package.$service/$method
```

(where $service MUST NOT contain dots and $method MUST NOT contain slashes)

If there is no package name or if it is unknown, the `$package.` part (including the period) is omitted.

Examples of span names:

- `grpc.test.EchoService/Echo`
- `com.example.ExampleRmiService/exampleMethod`
- `MyCalcService.Calculator/Add` reported by the server and
  `MyServiceReference.ICalculator/Add` reported by the client for .NET WCF calls
- `MyServiceWithNoPackage/theMethod`

### Service name

On the server process receiving and handling the remote procedure call, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not necessarily have to match the [`service.name`][] resource attribute.
One process can expose multiple RPC endpoints and thus have multiple RPC service names. From a deployment perspective, as expressed by the `service.*` resource attributes, it will be treated as one deployed service with one `service.name`.
Likewise, on clients sending RPC requests to a server, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not have to match the [`peer.service`][] span attribute.

As an example, given a process deployed as `QuoteService`, this would be the name that goes into the `service.name` resource attribute which applies to the entire process.
This process could expose two RPC endpoints, one called `CurrencyQuotes` (= `rpc.service`) with a method called `getMeanRate` (= `rpc.method`) and the other endpoint called `StockQuotes`  (= `rpc.service`) with two methods `getCurrentBid` and `getLastClose` (= `rpc.method`).
In this example, spans representing client request should have their `peer.service` attribute set to `QuoteService` as well to match the server's `service.name` resource attribute.
Generally, a user SHOULD NOT set `peer.service` to a fully qualified RPC service name.

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.system`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | A string identifying the remoting system. See below for a list of well-known identifiers. | `grpc`; `java_rmi`; `dotnet_wcf` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Required` | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [1] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` [3] | int | Server port number. [4] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [5] | `http` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [6] | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [7] | `tcp`; `udp` |
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective. [8] | `exampleMethod` |
| [`rpc.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. [9] | `myservice.EchoService` |

**[1] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3] `server.port`:** if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[4] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[7] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[8] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[9] `rpc.service`:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `rpc.message`.

Describes a message sent or received within the context of an RPC call.

In the lifetime of an RPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on client and server spans SHOULD be created. In case of unary calls only one sent and one received message will be recorded for both client and server spans.

### Distinction from HTTP spans

HTTP calls can generally be represented using just [HTTP spans](/docs/http/http-spans.md).
If they address a particular remote service and method known to the caller, i.e., when it is a remote procedure call transported over HTTP, the `rpc.*` attributes might be added additionally on that span, or in a separate RPC span that is a parent of the transporting HTTP call.
Note that *method* in this context is about the called remote procedure and *not* the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.).

## Semantic conventions for specific RPC technologies

More specific Semantic Conventions are defined for the following RPC technologies:

* [Connect](connect-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *Connect RPC*.
* [gRPC](grpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *gRPC*.
* [JSON-RPC](json-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *JSON-RPC*.
