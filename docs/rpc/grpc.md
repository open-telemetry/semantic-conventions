The Semantic Conventions for [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) extend and override the [RPC Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

### Client

<!-- semconv span.rpc.grpc.call.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

`rpc.system.name` MUST be set to `"grpc"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time.**

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status**: refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
document for details on how to record span status. See also `rpc.response.status_code` attribute
for the details on which values classify as errors.

**Attributes:**

| [`rpc.response.metadata.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string[] | RPC response metadata, `<key>` being the normalized RPC metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values. [8] | `["attribute_value"]` |

**[1] `rpc.method`:** The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
the original method value.

If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
`_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
RPC methods.

The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
method/function.
The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
RPC client stub method on the client side.

**[2] `rpc.response.status_code`:** All status codes except `OK` SHOULD be considered errors.

**[3] `server.address`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate `server.address` (along with `server.port`)
based on the configuration used when creating the gRPC channel and
SHOULD NOT use actual network-level connection information for this purpose
to ensure low cardinality.

Instrumentations MAY parse address and port from the gRPC target string
according to the [gRPC Name Resolution specification](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html),
depending on the scheme used. Or, they MAY use gRPC client APIs that
provide this information.

If the instrumentation cannot determine a server domain name or another
suitable low-cardinality identifier for a group of service instances
from the target string, it SHOULD set `server.address` to the entire
target string and SHOULD NOT set `server.port`.

When the address is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a
reverse proxy lookup to obtain a DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address`
to the IP address provided.

Examples:

- Given the target string `grpc.io:50051`, expected attributes:
  - `server.address`: `"grpc.io"`
  - `server.port`: `50051`
- Given the target string `dns://1.2.3.4/grpc.io:50051`, expected attributes:
  - `server.address`: `"grpc.io"`
  - `server.port`: `50051`
- Given the target string `unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock`, expected attributes:
  - `server.address`: `"/run/containerd/containerd.sock"`
  - `server.port`: not set
- Given the target string `zk://zookeeper:2181/my-server`, expected attributes:
  - `server.address`: "zk://zookeeper:2181/my-server"
  - `server.port`: not set
- Given the target string `ipv4:198.51.100.123:50051,198.51.100.124:50051`, expected attributes:
  - `server.address`: "ipv4:198.51.100.123:50051,198.51.100.124:50051"
  - `server.port`: not set

**[4] `error.type`:** If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
`error.type`.

**[5] `server.port`:** If and only if the port is available and `server.address` is set.

**[6] `server.port`:** See the `server.address` for details on parsing the target string.

**[7] `rpc.request.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
`rpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`

**[8] `rpc.response.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all response metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["attribute_value"]` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.response.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["attribute_value"]`

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

Semantic conventions for individual RPC systems SHOULD document how to populate this attribute.
When address is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse DNS lookup to obtain a DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the provided IP address.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `client.address`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.address` SHOULD represent the client address behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.
