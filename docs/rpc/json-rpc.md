# Semantic conventions for JSON-RPC

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) extend and override the [RPC spans](rpc-spans.md) and [RPC metrics](rpc-metrics.md) Semantic Conventions
that describe common RPC operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

## Client Span

<!-- semconv span.rpc.jsonrpc.call.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

`rpc.system.name` MUST be set to `"jsonrpc"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time.**

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
document for details on how to record span status. Responses that include
an [`error` object](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object)
are considered errors.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `-32602` |
| [`jsonrpc.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/jsonrpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If other than the default version (`1.0`) | string | Protocol version, as specified in the `jsonrpc` property of the request and its corresponding response. | `2.0`; `1.0` |
| [`rpc.method_original`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if it's different than `rpc.method`. | string | The original name of the method used by the client. | `com.myservice.EchoService/catchAll`; `com.myservice.EchoService/unknownMethod`; `InvalidMethod` |
| [`rpc.response.status_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` when available | string | The [`error.code`](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) property of response if it is an error response recorded as a string. [2] | `OK`; `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`; `-32602` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [3] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` [4] | int | Server port number. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`jsonrpc.request.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/jsonrpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A string representation of the `id` property of the request and its corresponding response. [6] | `10`; `request-7` |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [7] | `http` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [8] | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [9] | `tcp`; `udp` |
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string | JSON-RPC method name provided in the request. [10] | `com.example.ExampleService/exampleMethod`; `EchoService/Echo`; `_OTHER` |

**[1] `error.type`:** If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
`error.type`.

**[2] `rpc.response.status_code`:** All JSON RPC error codes SHOULD be considered errors.

**[3] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[4] `server.port`:** if `server.address` is set and if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `jsonrpc.request.id`:** Under the [JSON-RPC specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), the `id` property may be a string, number, null, or omitted entirely. When omitted, the request is treated as a notification. Using `null` is not equivalent to omitting the `id`, but it is discouraged.
Instrumentations SHOULD NOT capture this attribute when the `id` is `null` or omitted.

**[7] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[8] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[9] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[10] `rpc.method`:** JSON-RPC supports sending and receiving arbitrary method names without prior registration or definition. As a result, the method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.
General-purpose JSON-RPC instrumentations therefore SHOULD NOT set this attribute by default and SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized RPC methods. When tracing instrumentation converts RPC method to `_OTHER`, it MUST also set `rpc.method_original` span attribute to the original value.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |

`network.transport` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
