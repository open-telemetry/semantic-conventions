# Semantic conventions for JSON-RPC

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) extend and override the [RPC spans](rpc-spans.md) and [RPC metrics](rpc-metrics.md) Semantic Conventions
that describe common RPC operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

## Client Span

<!-- semconv span.rpc.jsonrpc.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

`rpc.system` MUST be set to `"jsonrpc"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time.**

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective. [1] | `exampleMethod` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Required` | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [2] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [3] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.error_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` when available | int | `error.code` property of response if it is an error response. | `-32700`; `100` |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If other than the default version (`1.0`) | string | Protocol version as in `jsonrpc` property of request/response. Since JSON-RPC 1.0 doesn't specify this, the value can be omitted. | `2.0`; `1.0` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` [4] | int | Server port number. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [6] | `http` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [7] | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [8] | `tcp`; `udp` |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.error_message`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | `error.message` property of response if it is an error response. | `Parse error`; `User already exists` |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.request_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | `id` property of request or response. Since protocol allows id to be int, string, `null` or missing (for notifications), value is expected to be cast to string for simplicity. Use empty string in case of `null` value. Omit entirely if this is a notification. | `10`; `request-7`; `` |

**[1] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[2] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[4] `server.port`:** if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[7] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[8] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
