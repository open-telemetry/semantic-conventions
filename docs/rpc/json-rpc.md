# Semantic conventions for JSON-RPC

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) extend and override the [RPC spans](rpc-spans.md) and [RPC metrics](rpc-metrics.md) Semantic Conventions
that describe common RPC operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

## Client Span

<!-- semconv span.rpc.jsonrpc.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

Remote procedure calls can only be represented with these semantic conventions
when the names of the called service and method are known and available.

`rpc.system` MUST be set to `"jsonrpc"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time.**

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](./rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | The name of the (logical) method being called, must be equal to the $method part in the span name. [1] | `exampleMethod` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.system`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | A string identifying the remoting system. See below for a list of well-known identifiers. | `jsonrpc` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [2] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.error_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | int | `error.code` property of response if it is an error response. | `-32700`; `100` | `Conditionally Required` If response is not successful. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | Protocol version as in `jsonrpc` property of request/response. Since JSON-RPC 1.0 doesn't specify this, the value can be omitted. | `2.0`; `1.0` | `Conditionally Required` If other than the default version (`1.0`) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | int | Server port number. [3] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` [4] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` | `Recommended` If `network.peer.address` is set. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [5] | `tcp`; `udp` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | [OSI network layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [6] | `ipv4`; `ipv6` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.error_message`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | `error.message` property of response if it is an error response. | `Parse error`; `User already exists` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.request_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | `id` property of request or response. Since protocol allows id to be int, string, `null` or missing (for notifications), value is expected to be cast to string for simplicity. Use empty string in case of `null` value. Omit entirely if this is a notification. | `10`; `request-7`; `` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. [7] | `myservice.EchoService` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[2] `server.address`:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[3] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4] `server.port`:** if the port is supported by the network transport used for communication.

**[5] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[6] `network.type`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[7] `rpc.service`:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

`network.transport` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
