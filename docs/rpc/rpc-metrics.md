# Semantic conventions for RPC metrics

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The conventions described in this section are RPC specific. When RPC operations
occur, measurements about those operations are recorded to instruments. The
measurements are aggregated and exported as metrics, which provide insight into
those operations. By including RPC properties as attributes on measurements, the
metrics can be filtered for finer grain analysis.

> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in their existing major version as a comma-separated list of category-specific values
>   (e.g., http, databases, rpc). The list of values includes:
>   * `rpc` - emit the stable RPC conventions, and stop emitting
>     the experimental RPC conventions that the instrumentation emitted
>     previously.
>   * `rpc/dup` - emit both the experimental and stable RPC conventions,
>     allowing for a phased rollout of the stable semantic conventions.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental RPC conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `rpc/dup` has higher precedence than `rpc` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) their existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * MAY drop the environment variable in their next major version and emit only

## Metric instruments

The following metric instruments MUST be used to describe RPC operations. They
MUST be of the specified type and units.

*Note: RPC server and client metrics are split to allow correlation across client/server boundaries, e.g. Lining up an RPC method latency to determine if the server is responsible for latency the client is seeing.*

### RPC server

Below is a list of RPC server metric instruments.

#### Metric: `rpc.server.call.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.50.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 ]`.

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |

| `rpc.server.call.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Measures the duration of inbound remote procedure calls (RPC). [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** When this metric is reported alongside an RPC server span, the metric value
SHOULD be the same as the RPC server span duration.

**Attributes:**

| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [3] | `http` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [4] | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | [OSI transport layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [5] | `tcp`; `udp` |
| [`rpc.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective. | `exampleMethod` |
| [`rpc.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. | `myservice.EchoService` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Opt-In` | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Opt-In` | int | Server port number. | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `rpc.system.name`:** The client and server RPC systems may differ for the same RPC interaction. For example, a client may use Apache Dubbo or Connect RPC to communicate with a server that uses gRPC since both protocols provide compatibility with gRPC.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[4] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[5] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[1] `rpc.system.name`:** The client and server RPC systems may differ for the same RPC interaction. For example, a client may use Apache Dubbo or Connect RPC to communicate with a server that uses gRPC since both protocols provide compatibility with gRPC.

**[2] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[4] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[7] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.
