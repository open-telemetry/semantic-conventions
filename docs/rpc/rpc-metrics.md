# Semantic Conventions for RPC Metrics

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The conventions described in this section are RPC specific. When RPC operations
occur, measurements about those operations are recorded to instruments. The
measurements are aggregated and exported as metrics, which provide insight into
those operations. By including RPC properties as attributes on measurements, the
metrics can be filtered for finer grain analysis.

> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in the existing major version which is a comma-separated list of values.
>   The only values defined so far are:
>   * `http` - emit the new, stable networking conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental networking conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `http/dup` - emit both the old and the stable networking conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental networking conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `http/dup` has higher precedence than `http` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version (stable
>   next major version SHOULD NOT be released prior to October 1, 2023).

## Metric instruments

The following metric instruments MUST be used to describe RPC operations. They
MUST be of the specified type and units.

*Note: RPC server and client metrics are split to allow correlation across client/server boundaries, e.g. Lining up an RPC method latency to determine if the server is responsible for latency the client is seeing.*

### RPC Server

Below is a list of RPC server metric instruments.

#### Metric: `rpc.server.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `rpc.server.duration` | Histogram | `ms` | Measures the duration of inbound RPC. [1] |

to end-of-batch, it's hard to interpret in practice.

**Streaming**: N/A.

## Attributes

Below is a table of attributes that SHOULD be included on client and server RPC
measurements.

<!-- semconv rpc -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.system`](rpc-spans.md) | string | A string identifying the remoting system. See below for a list of well-known identifiers. | `grpc` | Required |
| [`rpc.service`](rpc-spans.md) | string | The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable. [1] | `myservice.EchoService` | Recommended |
| [`rpc.method`](rpc-spans.md) | string | The name of the (logical) method being called, must be equal to the $method part in the span name. [2] | `exampleMethod` | Recommended |
| [`network.transport`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI Transport Layer](https://osi-model.com/transport-layer/) or [Inter-process Communication method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase. | `tcp`; `udp` | Recommended |
| [`network.type`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI Network Layer](https://osi-model.com/network-layer/) or non-OSI equivalent. The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase. | `ipv4`; `ipv6` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html). [3] | `example.com` | Required |
| [`server.port`](../general/attributes.md) | int | Server port number [4] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditionally Required: See below |
| [`server.socket.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Server address of the socket connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. [5] | `10.5.3.2` | See below |
| [`server.socket.port`](../general/attributes.md) | int | Server port number of the socket connection. [6] | `16456` | Recommended: [7] |

**[1]:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

**[2]:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[3]:** May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address, instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

**[4]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries (e.g. proxies) if it's available.

**[5]:** When observed from the client side, this SHOULD represent the immediate server peer address.
When observed from the server side, this SHOULD represent the physical server address.

**[6]:** When observed from the client side, this SHOULD represent the immediate server peer port.
When observed from the server side, this SHOULD represent the physical server port.

**[7]:** If different than `server.port` and if `server.socket.address` is set.

**Additional attribute requirements:** At least one of the following sets of attributes is required:

* [`server.socket.address`](../general/attributes.md)
* [`server.address`](../general/attributes.md)

`rpc.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `grpc` | gRPC |
| `java_rmi` | Java RMI |
| `dotnet_wcf` | .NET WCF |
| `apache_dubbo` | Apache Dubbo |
| `connect_rpc` | Connect RPC |
<!-- endsemconv -->

To avoid high cardinality, implementations should prefer the most stable of `server.address` or
`server.socket.address`, depending on expected deployment profile.  For many cloud applications, this is likely
`server.address` as names can be recycled even across re-instantiation of a server with a different `ip`.

For client-side metrics `server.port` is required if the connection is IP-based and the port is available (it describes the server port they are connecting to).
For server-side spans `server.port` is optional (it describes the port the client is connecting from).

### Service name

On the server process receiving and handling the remote procedure call, the service name provided in `rpc.service` does not necessarily have to match the [`service.name`][] resource attribute.
One process can expose multiple RPC endpoints and thus have multiple RPC service names. From a deployment perspective, as expressed by the `service.*` resource attributes, it will be treated as one deployed service with one `service.name`.

[`service.name`]: /docs/resource/README.md#service

## Semantic Conventions for specific RPC technologies

More specific Semantic Conventions are defined for the following RPC technologies:

* [Connect](connect-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *Connect RPC*.
* [gRPC](grpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *gRPC*.
* [JSON-RPC](json-rpc.md): Semantic Conventions for *JSON-RPC*.
