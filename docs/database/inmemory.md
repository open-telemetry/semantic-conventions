# Semantic conventions for database client spans

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus], Unless otherwise specified.

## Span definition

### In-memory Process

It is expected that `db.system.name` is set to inmemory.

**Status:** ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen)

This span describes in-memory database client call.

This span is for in-memory db calls. If the db runs in a different process to the client or when database calls happen over an
instrumented protocol such as HTTP, then the [db.client](/docs/database/database-spans.md#span-definition) span should be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
(e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
readily available at the generic query level.

**Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/database/database-spans.md#name) section.

**Span status** Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
document for details on how to record span status. Semantic conventions for
individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
classify as errors.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |

**[1] `db.system.name`:** The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
in non-batch operations.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[3] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.

**[4] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
in non-batch operations.

If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[6] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

**[8] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[9] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[10] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[11] `db.query.summary`:** The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
calls involving complex queries.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
[Generating query summary](/docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.

**[13] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[14] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).

**[15] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.

**[16] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** If operation applies to a specific stored procedure.

**[17] `db.query.parameter.<key>`:** If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

Examples:

- For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
  the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

- For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
  `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.system.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
