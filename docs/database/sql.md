# Semantic Conventions for SQL Databases

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The SQL databases Semantic Conventions describes how common [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md) apply to SQL databases.

The following database systems (defined in the [`db.system`](./database-spans.md#notes-and-well-known-identifiers-for-dbsystem) set) are known to use SQL as their primary query language:

- `cockroachdb`
- `db2`
- `derby`
- `edb`
- `firebird`
- `h2`
- `hsqldb`
- `ingres`
- `interbase`
- `mariadb`
- `maxdb`
- `mssql`
- `mssqlcompact`
- `mysql`
- `oracle`
- `other_sql`
- `pervasive`
- `postgresql`
- `sqlite`
- `trino`

Many other database systems support SQL and can be accessed via generic database driver such as JDBC or ODBC.
Instrumentations applied to generic SQL drivers SHOULD adhere to SQL semantic conventions.

| [`db.query.text`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The database query being executed. [9] | `SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = ?`; `SET mykey "WuValue"` | `Recommended` [10] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Name of the database host. [11] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The query parameters used in `db.query.text`, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being the parameter value. [12] | `someval`; `55` | `Opt-In` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the collection name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query and it SHOULD match the value provided in the query text including any schema and database name prefix.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used, otherwise `db.collection.name` SHOULD NOT be captured.

**[2]:** If readily available. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query.

**[3]:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated
(potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most
specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without
the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.

Unless specified by the system-specific semantic convention, the `db.namespace` attribute matches
the name of the database being accessed.

The database name can usually be obtained with database driver API such as
[JDBC `Connection.getCatalog()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#getCatalog--)
or [.NET `SqlConnection.Database`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.database).

Some database drivers don't detect when the current database is changed (for example, with SQL `USE database` statement).
Instrumentations that parse SQL statements MAY use the database name provided
in the connection string and keep track of the currently selected database name.

For commands that switch the database, this SHOULD be set to the target database (even if the command fails).

If instrumentation cannot reliably determine the current database name, it SHOULD NOT set `db.namespace`.

**[4]:** This SHOULD be the SQL command such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`.
In the case of `EXEC`, this SHOULD be the stored procedure name that is being executed.

**[5]:** If readily available. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.

**[6]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the database or the client library, the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[9]:** Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[10]:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data. Sanitization SHOULD be done by replacing all literals with a placeholder value. Such literals include, but are not limited to, String literals, Numeric literals, Date and Time literals, Boolean literals, Interval literals, Binary literals, and Hexadecimal literals. The placeholder value SHOULD be `?`, unless it already has a defined meaning in the given database system, in which case the instrumentation MAY choose a different placeholder.
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](../../docs/attributes-registry/db.md)). Placeholders in a parametrized query SHOULD not be sanitized. E.g. `where id = $1` can be captured as is, and  there is no need to sanitize the value `$1`.

**[11]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[12]:** Query parameters should only be captured when `db.query.text` is parameterized with placeholders.
If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Example

This is an example of attributes for a MySQL database span:

| Key                    | Value |
|:-----------------------| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Span name              | `"SELECT orders"` |
| `db.collection.name`   | `"orders"` |
| `db.namespace`         | `"ShopDb"` |
| `db.system`            | `"mysql"` |
| `server.address`       | `"shopdb.example.com"` |
| `server.port`          | `3306` |
| `db.query.text`        | `"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 'o4711'"` |
| `db.operation.name`    | `"SELECT"` |
