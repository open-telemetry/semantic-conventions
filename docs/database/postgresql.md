# Semantic Conventions for PostgreSQL

**Status**: [Release Candidate][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for *PostgreSQL* extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md).

`db.system` MUST be set to `"postgresql"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**[1] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

A single database query may involve multiple collections.

If the collection name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
contain a single collection and it SHOULD match the value provided in
the query text including any schema and database name prefix.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
then that collection name SHOULD be used.

If the operation or query involves multiple collections, `db.collection.name`
SHOULD NOT be captured.

This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single collection name in the query.

**[3] `db.namespace`:** `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the combination of database and schema name following the `{database}.{schema}` pattern.

A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `SET search_path TO <schema>`.
If the search path has multiple schemas, the first schema in the search path SHOULD be used.

If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated schema on each query
without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT current_schema()`),
then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the schema provided when the connection was established.

Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the schema provided when the connection was established.

Instrumentation MAY use the user name when the connection was established as a stand-in for the schema name.

Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the user provided when the connection was established.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[4] `db.operation.name`:** This SHOULD be the SQL command such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`.
In the case of `EXEC`, this SHOULD be the stored procedure name that is being executed.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[6] `db.response.status_code`:** SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
for the details.

Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
the most specific code available to them.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
at all):

- [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
- [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/)
- [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
- [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
- [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
- [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
it SHOULD be used.

When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
`db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

**[7] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[10] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[11] `db.query.summary`:** `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.
Summary may be available to the instrumentation through instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following [Generating query summary](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query-text) section.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.

**[13] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[14] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.operation.parameter.<key>`](../../docs/attributes-registry/db.md)).

**[15] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16] `db.operation.parameter`:** If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.
If `db.query.text` is also captured, then `db.operation.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
