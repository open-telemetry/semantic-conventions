# Semantic Conventions for Database Calls and Systems

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for database client spans as well as
database metrics and logs.

> **Warning**
> Existing database instrumentations that are using
> [v1.24.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/database/README.md)
> (or prior) SHOULD NOT change the version of the database conventions that they emit
> until a transition plan to the (future) stable semantic conventions has been published.
> Conventions include, but are not limited to, attributes, metric and span names, and unit of measure.
