# Semantic conventions for MySQL client operations

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus], Unless otherwise specified.

<!-- toc -->

- [Spans](#spans)
- [Metrics](#metrics)

<!-- tocstop -->

The Semantic Conventions for *MySQL* extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

<!-- semconv span.db.mysql.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen)

Spans representing calls to a MySQL Server adhere to the general [Semantic Conventions for Database Client Spans](database-spans.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"mysql"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `db.namespace`:** A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DATABASE()`),
then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[2] `db.response.status_code`:** MySQL error codes are vendor specific error codes and don't follow [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) conventions. All MySQL error codes SHOULD be considered errors.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[4] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `db.collection.name`:** If the operation is executed via a higher-level API that does not support multiple collection names.

**[7] `db.collection.name`:** The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`.

**[8] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[9] `db.operation.name`:** If the operation is executed via a higher-level API that does not support multiple operation names.

**[10] `db.operation.name`:** The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`.

**[11] `db.query.summary`:** if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
calls involving complex queries.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
[Generating query summary](/docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[13] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).

**[14] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[15] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** If operation applies to a specific stored procedure.

**[16] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.

**[17] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[18] `db.query.parameter.<key>`:** If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

Examples:

- For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
  the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

- For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
  `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Metrics

MySQL client instrumentations SHOULD collect metrics according to the general
[Semantic Conventions for Database Client Metrics](database-metrics.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"mysql"`.
