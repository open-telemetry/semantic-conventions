> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in the existing major version which is a comma-separated list of values.
>   The list of values includes:
>   * `database` - emit the new, stable database conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental database conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `database/dup` - emit both the old and the stable database conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental database conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `database/dup` has higher precedence than `database` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.

## Database operation

### Metric: `db.client.operation.duration`

**Status**: [Release Candidate][DocumentStatus]

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

When this metric is reported alongside a database operation span, the metric value SHOULD be the same as the database operation span duration.

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ]`.

**[1] `db.system.name`:** The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
unless the query format is known to only ever have a single collection name present.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[3] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single collection name in the query.

**[4] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
unless the query format is known to only ever have a single operation name present.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[6] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

**[8] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[9] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[10] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[11] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.
Summary may be available to the instrumentation through instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following [Generating query summary](../database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query-text) section.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.

**[14] `network.peer.address`:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[15] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

## Development

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

### Database Response

The following metric instruments describe database query response.

#### Metric: `db.client.response.returned_rows`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]`.

Explaining bucket configuration:

1. 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100: These buckets are useful for capturing scenarios where only a small number of items are returned. Such small queries are common in real-time or interactive applications where performance and quick responses are critical.
2. 200, 500, 1000: These values represent typical workloads where moderate amounts of data are returned in each query.
3. 2000, 5000: These boundaries capture scenarios where the query returns large datasets. These larger page sizes can potentially increase memory or CPU usage and may lead to longer query execution times, making it important to track performance in these ranges.
4. 10000: This boundary is included to capture rare, very large response sizes. Such queries can put significant strain on system resources, including memory, CPU, and network bandwidth, and can often lead to performance issues such as high latency or even network drops.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following [Generating query summary](../database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query-text) section.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.

**[14] `network.peer.address`:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[15] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
