# Semantic Conventions for Redis

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Redis](https://redis.com/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md).

`db.system` MUST be set to `"redis"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**[1]:** A connection's currently associated database index may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `SELECT <index>`.

If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database index on each query
without triggering an additional query to be executed,
then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database index provided when the connection was established.

Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database index provided when the connection was established.

**[2]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

A single database query may involve multiple operations. If the operation
name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
contain a single operation or when the operation name describing the
whole query is available by other means.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[3]:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[4]:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[5]:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[6]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[9]:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[10]:** For **Redis**, the value provided for `db.query.text` SHOULD correspond to the syntax of the Redis CLI. If, for example, the [`HMSET` command](https://redis.io/commands/hmset) is invoked, `"HMSET myhash field1 'Hello' field2 'World'"` would be a suitable value for `db.query.text`.

**[11]:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text.
See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](../../docs/attributes-registry/db.md)).

**[12]:** If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[13]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[14]:** Query parameters should only be captured when `db.query.text` is parameterized with placeholders.
If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Example

In this example, Redis is connected using a unix domain socket and therefore the connection string is left out.

| Key                       | Value |
|:--------------------------| :-------------------------------------------- |
| Span name                 | `"HMSET 15"` |
| `db.system`               | `"redis"` |
| `network.peer.address`    | `"/tmp/redis.sock"` |
| `network.transport`       | `"unix"` |
| `db.namespace`            | `"15"` |
| `db.query.text`           | `"HMSET myhash field1 'Hello' field2 'World"` |
| `db.operation.name`       | `"HMSET"` |
