# Semantic Conventions for HBase

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md).

`db.system` MUST be set to `"hbase"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The HBase table name. [1] | `mytable`; `ns:table` | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The HBase namespace. [2] | `mynamespace` | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The name of the operation or command being executed. [3] | `findAndModify`; `HMSET`; `SELECT` | `Conditionally Required` [4] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.response.status_code`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | Protocol-specific response code recorded as string. [5] | `200`; `409`; `14` | `Conditionally Required` If response was received. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [6] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [7] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` [8] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`db.operation.batch.size`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | int | The number of queries included in a batch operation. [9] | `2`; `3`; `4` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Name of the database host. [10] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1]:** If table name includes the namespace, the `db.collection.name` SHOULD be set to the full table name.

**[2]:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[3]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the operation name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `, otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database system specific term if more applicable.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[4]:** If readily available. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.

**[5]:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[6]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[9]:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[10]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
