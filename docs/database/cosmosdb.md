# Semantic Conventions for Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Microsoft Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cosmos-db/)
extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md).

## Attributes

`db.system` MUST be set to `"cosmosdb"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

Cosmos DB instrumentation includes call-level (public API) surface spans and network spans. Depending on the connection mode (Gateway or Direct), network-level spans may also be created.

**[1] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[2] `db.cosmosdb.connection_mode`:** if not `gateway` (the default value is assumed to be `gateway`).

**[3] `db.cosmosdb.regions_contacted`:** Region name matches the format of `displayName` in [Azure Location API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/subscription/subscriptions/list-locations?view=rest-subscription-2021-10-01&tabs=HTTP#location)

**[4] `db.operation.name`:** The `db.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values.
If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used.

Batch operations:

- `execute_batch`

Bulk operations:

- `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
  [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations)).
  which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
- `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
  within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
  For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
  property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

Change feed operations:

- `query_change_feed`

Conflicts operations:

- `delete_conflict`
- `query_conflicts`
- `read_all_conflicts`
- `read_conflict`

Container operations:

- `create_container`
- `create_container_if_not_exists`
- `delete_container`
- `query_containers`
- `read_all_containers`

- `read_container_throughput`
- `replace_container`
- `replace_container_throughput`

Database operations:

- `read_all_client_encryption_keys`
- `read_client_encryption_key`
- `replace_client_encryption_key`

Item operations:

- `create_item`
- `delete_all_items_by_partition_key`
- `delete_item`
- `patch_item`
- `query_items`
- `read_all_items`
- `read_all_items_of_logical_partition`
- `read_many_items`

Permission operations:

- `create_permission`
- `delete_permission`
- `query_permissions`
- `read_all_permissions`
- `read_permission`
- `replace_permission`

- `create_user_defined_function`
- `delete_user_defined_function`
- `query_user_defined_functions`
- `read_all_user_defined_functions`
- `read_user_defined_function`

If none of them applies, it's RECOMMENDED to use language-agnostic representation of
client method name in snake_case. Instrumentations SHOULD document
additional values when introducing new operations.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[6] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[7] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `az.namespace`:** When `az.namespace` attribute is populated, it MUST be set to `Microsoft.DocumentDB` for all operations performed by Cosmos DB client.

**[10] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[11] `db.query.summary`:** `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.
Summary may be available to the instrumentation through instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following [Generating query summary](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-quey-text) section.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.

**[13] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[14] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.operation.parameter.<key>`](../../docs/attributes-registry/db.md)).

**[15] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16] `user_agent.original`:** The user-agent value is generated by SDK which is a combination of<br> `sdk_version` : Current version of SDK. e.g. 'cosmos-netstandard-sdk/3.23.0'<br> `direct_pkg_version` : Direct package version used by Cosmos DB SDK. e.g. '3.23.1'<br> `number_of_client_instances` : Number of cosmos client instances created by the application. e.g. '1'<br> `type_of_machine_architecture` : Machine architecture. e.g. 'X64'<br> `operating_system` : Operating System. e.g. 'Linux 5.4.0-1098-azure 104 18'<br> `runtime_framework` : Runtime Framework. e.g. '.NET Core 3.1.32'<br> `failover_information` : Generated key to determine if region failover enabled.
   Format Reg-{D (Disabled discovery)}-S(application region)|L(List of preferred regions)|N(None, user did not configure it).
   Default value is "NS".

**[17] `db.operation.parameter`:** If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.
If `db.query.text` is also captured, then `db.operation.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)

## Operation Level Metrics

The following metrics provide insights into Azure Cosmos DB client operation performance and behavior.

### Metric: `db.client.operation.duration`

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

It captures the total time taken by an Azure Cosmos DB operation. This metric follows the common [db.client.operation.duration](/docs/database/database-metrics.md#metric-dbclientoperationduration) definition.

Refer [db.client.cosmosdb.operation.request_charge](#metric-dbclientcosmosdboperationrequest_charge) metrics for dimensions.

### Metric: `db.client.response.returned_rows`

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

It captures the number of items returned by a query or feed operation in Azure Cosmos DB. It helps identify response sizes that may contribute to high latency, increased memory/CPU usage, or network call failures. This metric follows the common [db.client.response.returned_rows](/docs/database/database-metrics.md##metric-dbclientresponsereturned_rows) definition.

Refer [db.client.cosmosdb.operation.request_charge](#metric-dbclientcosmosdboperationrequest_charge) metrics for dimensions.

### Metric: `db.client.cosmosdb.operation.request_charge`

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

It captures the Request Units consumed by each operation in Azure Cosmos DB. Since Request Units serve as a form of throughput control within the Azure Cosmos DB database, monitoring their usage is crucial to avoid throttling.

this metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.35.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]`.

Explaining bucket configuration:

1. 1, 5, 10: Low Usage Levels, These smaller buckets allow for precise tracking of operations that consume a minimal number of Request Units. This is important for lightweight operations, such as basic read requests or small queries, where resource utilization should be optimized. Monitoring these low usage levels can help ensure that the application is not inadvertently using more resources than necessary.
2. 25, 50: Moderate Usage Levels, These ranges capture more moderate operations, which are typical in many applications. For example, queries that return a reasonable amount of data or perform standard CRUD operations may fall within these limits. Identifying usage patterns in these buckets can help detect efficiency issues in routine operations.
3. 100, 250: Higher Usage Levels, These boundaries represent operations that may require significant resources, such as complex queries or larger transactions. Monitoring RUs in these ranges can help identify performance bottlenecks or costly queries that might lead to throttling.
4. 500, 1000: Very High Usage Levels, These buckets capture operations that consume a substantial number of Request Units, which may indicate potentially expensive queries or batch processes. Understanding the frequency and patterns of such high RU usage can be critical in optimizing performance and ensuring the application remains within provisioned throughput limits.

**[2] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application

A single database query may involve multiple operations. If the operation
name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
contain a single operation or when the operation name describing the
whole query is available by other means.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[5] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[6] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

### Metric: `db.client.cosmosdb.active_instance.count`

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

It captures the number of active instances at any given time. Best practices dictate that there should ideally be only one instance of the SDK client per Azure Cosmos DB account. Having multiple instances of the SDK client for the same account in a single process can lead to CPU or memory-related issues.

Explaining bucket configuration:

1. 0, 64 KB, 128 KB, 256 KB, 512 KB: Low-Range Buckets, These smaller buckets capture typical, lightweight requests, often associated with quick read or write operations.
2. 1 MB, 1.5 MB: Medium-Range Buckets, These mid-sized buckets help identify requests that are moderately large but still manageable for Cosmos DB.
3. 2 MB: Higher Usage Levels, The 2 MB bucket is critical because it represents the threshold between "normal" and "large" requests.
4. 2.5 MB, 3 MB, 4 MB, 6 MB, 8 MB, 10 MB: High-Range Buckets, These larger buckets track heavy requests that could be problematic, such as those involving batch operations or complex data structures.

### Metric: `db.client.cosmosdb.response.body.size`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

It is the size of response received from Azure Cosmos DB backend.

this metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.35.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[0, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1572864, 2097152, 2621440, 3145728, 4194304, 6291456, 8388608, 10485760]`.

Explaining bucket configuration:

1. 0, 64 KB, 128 KB, 256 KB, 512 KB: Low-Range Buckets, These capture small responses, which are common for brief reads or simple queries. For example, a small document read or a single record fetch might fit within these sizes. Tracking smaller response sizes is useful because they typically represent low-cost, low-latency operations, which are the backbone of many database transactions. This level of detail helps verify that these requests stay efficient and small.
2. 1 MB, 1.5 MB: Medium-Range Buckets, Responses in this range indicate larger queries, perhaps with more data fields or multiple records.
3. 2 MB: Higher Usage Levels, This bucket marks the threshold for what might be considered a "large" response. Responses at or above 2 MB are usually a sign of heavy queries that could increase database load and network latency.
4. 2.5 MB, 3 MB, 4 MB, 6 MB, 8 MB, 10 MB: High-Range Buckets, These larger buckets track responses that involve heavy data loads, such as large result sets from complex queries or high-throughput batch reads.

### Metric: `db.client.cosmosdb.request.transit.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

It captures transit time that refers to the duration taken by a request to travel across the network—from the moment it leaves the client to when the response is received back at the client. It is only applicable in Direct Mode.

this metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.35.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ]`.

**[1]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[2]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

A single database query may involve multiple operations. If the operation
name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
contain a single operation or when the operation name describing the
whole query is available by other means.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[3]:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[4]:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[5]:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[6]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[7]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[8]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[10]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

### Metric: `db.client.cosmosdb.request.received.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

It captures the "received" time, that is the duration from when the response is received until it is fully processed by the SDK. It is only applicable in Direct Mode.

this metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.35.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
