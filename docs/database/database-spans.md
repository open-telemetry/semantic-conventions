> Existing database instrumentations that are using
> [v1.24.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/database/database-spans.md)
> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the database conventions that they emit
>   until the database semantic conventions are marked stable.
>   Conventions include, but are not limited to, attributes,
>   metric and span names, and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in the existing major version which is a comma-separated list of values.
>   If the list of values includes:
>   * `database` - emit the new, stable database conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental database conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `database/dup` - emit both the old and the stable database conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental database conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `database/dup` has higher precedence than `database` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.

**Span kind:** MUST always be `CLIENT`.

Span that describes database call SHOULD cover the duration of the corresponding call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding span should cover the duration of the logical operation
with all retries.

## Name

Database spans MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.33.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
<!-- HTML anchors are not supported https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check/issues/225-->
The **span name** SHOULD be `{db.operation.name} {target}` if there is a
(low-cardinality) `{db.operation.name}` available (see below for the exact definition of the [`{target}`](#target-placeholder) placeholder).

If there is no (low-cardinality) `db.operation.name` available, database span names
SHOULD be [`{target}`](#target-placeholder).
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

If neither `{db.operation.name}` nor `{target}` are available, span name SHOULD be `{db.system}`.

Semantic conventions for individual database systems MAY specify different span name format.

The <span id="target-placeholder">`{target}`</span> SHOULD describe the entity that the operation is performed against
and SHOULD adhere to one of the following values, provided they are accessible:

- `db.collection.name` SHOULD be used for data manipulation operations or operations on database collections.
- `db.namespace` SHOULD be used for operations on a specific database namespace.
- `server.address:server.port` SHOULD be used for other operations not targeting any specific database(s) or collection(s)

If a corresponding `{target}` value is not available for a specific operation, the instrumentation SHOULD omit the `{target}`.
For example, for an operation describing SQL query on an anonymous table like `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM table) t`, span name should be `SELECT`.

## Common attributes

These attributes will usually be the same for all operations performed over the same database connection.

**[1]:** The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the collection name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query and it SHOULD match the value provided in the query text including any schema and database name prefix.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used, otherwise `db.collection.name` SHOULD NOT be captured.

**[3]:** If readily available. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query.

**[4]:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[5]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the operation name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `, otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database system specific term if more applicable.

**[6]:** If readily available. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.

**[7]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the database or the client library, the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[8]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[10]:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[11]:** SHOULD be collected by default only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

**[12]:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[13]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[14]:** Query parameters should only be captured when `db.query.text` is parameterized with placeholders.
If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

### Notes and well-known identifiers for `db.system`

The list above is a non-exhaustive list of well-known identifiers to be specified for `db.system`.

If a value defined in this list applies to the DBMS to which the request is sent, this value MUST be used.
If no value defined in this list is suitable, a custom value MUST be provided.
This custom value MUST be the name of the DBMS in lowercase and without a version number to stay consistent with existing identifiers.

It is encouraged to open a PR towards this specification to add missing values to the list, especially when instrumentations for those missing databases are written.
This allows multiple instrumentations for the same database to be aligned and eases analyzing for backends.

The value `other_sql` is intended as a fallback and MUST only be used if the DBMS is known to be SQL-compliant but the concrete product is not known to the instrumentation.
If the concrete DBMS is known to the instrumentation, its specific identifier MUST be used.

Back ends could, for example, use the provided identifier to determine the appropriate SQL dialect for parsing the `db.query.text`.

When additional attributes are added that only apply to a specific DBMS, its identifier SHOULD be used as a namespace in the attribute key as for the attributes in the sections below.

## Sanitization of `db.query.text`

The `db.query.text` SHOULD be collected by default only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information.
Sanitization SHOULD replace all literals with a placeholder value.
Such literals include, but are not limited to, String, Numeric, Date and Time,
Boolean, Interval, Binary, and Hexadecimal literals.
The placeholder value SHOULD be `?`, unless it already has a defined meaning in the given database system,
in which case the instrumentation MAY choose a different placeholder.

Placeholders in a parameterized query SHOULD not be sanitized. E.g. `where id = $1` can be captured as is.

## Semantic Conventions for specific database technologies

More specific Semantic Conventions are defined for the following database technologies:

* [AWS DynamoDB](dynamodb.md): Semantic Conventions for *AWS DynamoDB*.
* [Cassandra](cassandra.md): Semantic Conventions for *Cassandra*.
* [Cosmos DB](cosmosdb.md): Semantic Conventions for *Microsoft Cosmos DB*.
* [CouchDB](couchdb.md): Semantic Conventions for *CouchDB*.
* [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md): Semantic Conventions for *Elasticsearch*.
* [HBase](hbase.md): Semantic Conventions for *HBase*.
* [MongoDB](mongodb.md): Semantic Conventions for *MongoDB*.
* [MSSQL](mssql.md): Semantic Conventions for *MSSQL*.
* [Redis](redis.md): Semantic Conventions for *Redis*.
* [SQL](sql.md): Semantic Conventions for *SQL* databases.
