>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental networking conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `http/dup` has higher precedence than `http` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.

**Span kind:** MUST always be `CLIENT`.

The **span name** SHOULD be set to a low cardinality value representing the statement executed on the database.
It MAY be a stored procedure name (without arguments), DB statement without variable arguments, operation name, etc.
Since SQL statements may have very high cardinality even without arguments, SQL spans SHOULD be named the
following way, unless the statement is known to be of low cardinality:
`<db.operation> <db.name>.<db.sql.table>`, provided that `db.operation` and `db.sql.table` are available.
If `db.sql.table` is not available due to its semantics, the span SHOULD be named `<db.operation> <db.name>`.
It is not recommended to attempt any client-side parsing of `db.statement` just to get these properties,
they should only be used if the library being instrumented already provides them.
When it's otherwise impossible to get any meaningful span name, `db.name` or the tech-specific database name MAY be used.

Span that describes database call SHOULD cover the duration of the corresponding call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding span should cover the duration of the logical operation
with all retries.

## Common attributes

These attributes will usually be the same for all operations performed over the same database connection.
Some database systems may allow a connection to switch to a different `db.user`, for example, and other database systems may not even have the concept of a connection at all.

<!-- semconv db(full) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`db.instance.id`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | An identifier (address, unique name, or any other identifier) of the database instance that is executing queries or mutations on the current connection. This is useful in cases where the database is running in a clustered environment and the instrumentation is able to record the node executing the query. The client may obtain this value in databases like MySQL using queries like `select @@hostname`. | `mysql-e26b99z.example.com` | Recommended: If different from the `server.address` |
| [`db.name`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | This attribute is used to report the name of the database being accessed. For commands that switch the database, this should be set to the target database (even if the command fails). [1] | `customers`; `main` | Conditionally Required: If applicable. |
| [`db.operation`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The name of the operation being executed, e.g. the [MongoDB command name](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/#database-operations) such as `findAndModify`, or the SQL keyword. [2] | `findAndModify`; `HMSET`; `SELECT` | Conditionally Required: If `db.statement` is not applicable. |
| [`db.statement`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The database statement being executed. | `SELECT * FROM wuser_table`; `SET mykey "WuValue"` | Recommended: [3] |
| [`db.system`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | An identifier for the database management system (DBMS) product being used. See below for a list of well-known identifiers. | `other_sql` | Required |
| [`db.user`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | Username for accessing the database. | `readonly_user`; `reporting_user` | Recommended |
| [`network.peer.address`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Recommended |
| [`network.peer.port`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` | Recommended: If `network.peer.address` is set. |
| [`network.transport`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | [OSI transport layer](https://osi-model.com/transport-layer/) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). [4] | `tcp`; `udp` | Recommended |
| [`network.type`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | [OSI network layer](https://osi-model.com/network-layer/) or non-OSI equivalent. [5] | `ipv4`; `ipv6` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Name of the database host. [6] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Recommended |
| [`server.port`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [7] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditionally Required: [8] |

**[1]:** In some SQL databases, the database name to be used is called "schema name". In case there are multiple layers that could be considered for database name (e.g. Oracle instance name and schema name), the database name to be used is the more specific layer (e.g. Oracle schema name).

**[2]:** When setting this to an SQL keyword, it is not recommended to attempt any client-side parsing of `db.statement` just to get this property, but it should be set if the operation name is provided by the library being instrumented. If the SQL statement has an ambiguous operation, or performs more than one operation, this value may be omitted.

**[3]:** Should be collected by default only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information.

**[4]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[5]:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

### Notes and well-known identifiers for `db.system`

The list above is a non-exhaustive list of well-known identifiers to be specified for `db.system`.

If a value defined in this list applies to the DBMS to which the request is sent, this value MUST be used.
If no value defined in this list is suitable, a custom value MUST be provided.
This custom value MUST be the name of the DBMS in lowercase and without a version number to stay consistent with existing identifiers.

It is encouraged to open a PR towards this specification to add missing values to the list, especially when instrumentations for those missing databases are written.
This allows multiple instrumentations for the same database to be aligned and eases analyzing for backends.

The value `other_sql` is intended as a fallback and MUST only be used if the DBMS is known to be SQL-compliant but the concrete product is not known to the instrumentation.
If the concrete DBMS is known to the instrumentation, its specific identifier MUST be used.

Back ends could, for example, use the provided identifier to determine the appropriate SQL dialect for parsing the `db.statement`.

When additional attributes are added that only apply to a specific DBMS, its identifier SHOULD be used as a namespace in the attribute key as for the attributes in the sections below.
