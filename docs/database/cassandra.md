# Semantic Conventions for Cassandra

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md).

`db.system` MUST be set to `"cassandra"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**[1]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the collection name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query and it SHOULD match the value provided in the query text including any schema and database name prefix.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used, otherwise `db.collection.name` SHOULD NOT be captured.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[2]:** If readily available. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query.

**[3]:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[4]:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
If the operation name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `, otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database system specific term if more applicable.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[5]:** If readily available. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.

**[6]:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[7]:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[8]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[9]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[10]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[11]:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[12]:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

**[13]:** SHOULD be collected by default only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

**[14]:** If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[15]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16]:** Query parameters should only be captured when `db.query.text` is parameterized with placeholders.
If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.
This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
