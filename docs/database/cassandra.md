# Semantic conventions for Cassandra

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

<!-- toc -->

- [Spans](#spans)
- [Metrics](#metrics)

<!-- tocstop -->

The Semantic Conventions for [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

Spans representing calls to a Cassandra database adhere to the general [Semantic Conventions for Database Client Spans](database-spans.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"cassandra"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

The following table outlines the span attributes applicable to Cassandra.

**[1] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
unless the query format is known to only ever have a single collection name present.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection. The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single collection name in the query.

**[3] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[4] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
unless the query format is known to only ever have a single operation name present.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text, in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.

**[6] `db.response.status_code`:** All Cassandra protocol error codes SHOULD be considered errors.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[8] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[9] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[10] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[11] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.
Summary may be available to the instrumentation through instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following [Generating query summary](../database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query-text) section.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.

**[14] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[15] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.operation.parameter.<key>`](../attributes-registry/db.md)).

**[16] `network.peer.address`:** If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[17] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[18] `db.operation.parameter`:** If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index, then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.
If `db.query.text` is also captured, then `db.operation.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)

## Metrics

Cassandra client instrumentations SHOULD collect metrics according to the general
[Semantic Conventions for Database Client Metrics](database-metrics.md).

`db.system` MUST be set to `"cassandra"`.
