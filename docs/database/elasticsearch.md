# Semantic Conventions for Elasticsearch

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md)
that describe common database operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`db.system` MUST be set to `"elasticsearch"`.

## Span Name

The **span name** SHOULD be of the format `<endpoint id>`.

The elasticsearch endpoint identifier is used instead of the url path in order to reduce the cardinality of the span
name, as the path could contain dynamic values. The endpoint id is the `name` field in the
[elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json).
If the endpoint id is not available, the span name SHOULD be the `http.request.method`.

## Attributes

<!-- semconv db.elasticsearch(full,tag=tech-specific) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`db.operation.name`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The name of the operation or command being executed. [1] | `search`; `ml.close_job`; `cat.aliases` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`http.request.method`](../attributes-registry/http.md) | string | HTTP request method. [2] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`url.full`](../attributes-registry/url.md) | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [3] | `https://localhost:9200/index/_search?q=user.id:kimchy` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`db.elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | A dynamic value in the url path. [4] | `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.index=test-index`; `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.doc_id=123` | `Conditionally Required` when the url has dynamic values | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.port`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` [6] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`db.elasticsearch.cluster.name`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | Represents the identifier of an Elasticsearch cluster. | `e9106fc68e3044f0b1475b04bf4ffd5f` | `Recommended` [7] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.instance.id`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | An identifier (address, unique name, or any other identifier) of the database instance that is executing queries or mutations on the current connection. This is useful in cases where the database is running in a clustered environment and the instrumentation is able to record the node executing the query. The client may obtain this value in databases like MySQL using queries like `select @@hostname`. | `mysql-e26b99z.example.com` | `Recommended` [8] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.query.text`](../attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The request body for a [search-type query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html), as a json string. | `"{\"query\":{\"term\":{\"user.id\":\"kimchy\"}}}"` | `Recommended` [9] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`network.peer.address`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Peer address of the database node where the operation was performed. [10] | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.port`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | int | Peer port number of the network connection. | `65123` | `Recommended` if and only if `network.peer.address` is set. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.address`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Name of the database host. [11] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1]:** This SHOULD be the endpoint identifier for the request.

**[2]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[3]:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.
`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.
`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed). Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[4]:** Many Elasticsearch url paths allow dynamic values. These SHOULD be recorded in span attributes in the format `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`, where `<key>` is the url path part name. The implementation SHOULD reference the [elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json) in order to map the path part values to their names.

**[5]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[7]:** When communicating with an Elastic Cloud deployment, this should be collected from the "X-Found-Handling-Cluster" HTTP response header.

**[8]:** When communicating with an Elastic Cloud deployment, this should be collected from the "X-Found-Handling-Instance" HTTP response header.

**[9]:** Should be collected by default for search-type queries and only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information.

**[10]:** If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[11]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `DELETE` | DELETE method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `GET` | GET method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `HEAD` | HEAD method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `OPTIONS` | OPTIONS method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `PATCH` | PATCH method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `POST` | POST method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `PUT` | PUT method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `TRACE` | TRACE method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `_OTHER` | Any HTTP method that the instrumentation has no prior knowledge of. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
