# Semantic Conventions for Elasticsearch

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](database-spans.md)
that describe common database operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`db.system` MUST be set to `"elasticsearch"`.

## Span Name

The **span name** follows the [general database span name guidelines](database-spans.md#name) with the endpoint identifier stored in `db.operation.name`, and the index stored in `db.collection.name`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |

[4] | `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.index=test-index`; `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.doc_id=123` | `Conditionally Required` when the url has dynamic values | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [5] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [6] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` [7] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`db.collection.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The index or data stream against which the query is executed. [8] | `my_index`; `index1, index2` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.elasticsearch.node.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | Represents the human-readable identifier of the node/instance to which a request was routed. [9] | `instance-0000000001` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The name of the Elasticsearch cluster which the client connects to. [10] | `customers`; `test.users` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`db.query.text`](/docs/attributes-registry/db.md) | string | The request body for a [search-type query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html), as a json string. [11] | `"{\"query\":{\"term\":{\"user.id\":\"kimchy\"}}}"` | `Recommended` [12] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Name of the database host. [13] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1]:** The `db.operation.name` SHOULD match the endpoint identifier provided in the request (see the [Elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json)).

**[2]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[3]:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.
`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.
`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed). Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[4]:** Many Elasticsearch url paths allow dynamic values. These SHOULD be recorded in span attributes in the format `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`, where `<key>` is the url path part name. The implementation SHOULD reference the [elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json) in order to map the path part values to their names.

**[5]:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the database or the client library, the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[6]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7]:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[8]:** The query may target multiple indices or data streams, in which case it SHOULD be a comma separated list of those. If the query doesn't target a specific index, this field MUST NOT be set.

**[9]:** When communicating with an Elastic Cloud deployment, this should be collected from the "X-Found-Handling-Instance" HTTP response header.

**[10]:** When communicating with an Elastic Cloud deployment, this should be collected from the "X-Found-Handling-Cluster" HTTP response header.

**[11]:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[12]:** Should be collected by default for search-type queries and only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information.

**[13]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |


`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | Any HTTP method that the instrumentation has no prior knowledge of. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
