**[1] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[2] `url.path`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.path` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[3] `url.scheme`:** The scheme of the original client request, if known (e.g. from [Forwarded#proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded#proto), [X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto), or a similar header). Otherwise, the scheme of the immediate peer request.

**[4] `error.type`:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[5] `http.request.method_original`:** If and only if it's different than `http.request.method`.

**[6] `http.route`:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

**[7] `network.protocol.name`:** If not `http` and `network.protocol.version` is set.

**[8] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[9] `server.port`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).

**[10] `url.query`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.query` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`q=OpenTelemetry&sig=REDACTED`.

**[11] `client.address`:** The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if known (e.g. from [Forwarded#for](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded#for), [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For), or a similar header). Otherwise, the immediate client peer address.

**[12] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[13] `server.address`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).

**[14] `client.port`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.port` SHOULD represent the client port behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

**[15] `http.request.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
  attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[16] `http.response.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all response headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.response.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `My-custom-header: abc, def` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.response.header.my-custom-header`
  attribute with value `["abc", "def"]` or `["abc, def"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[17] `network.transport`:** Generally `tcp` for `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, and `HTTP/2`. Generally `udp` for `HTTP/3`. Other obscure implementations are possible.

**[18] `user_agent.synthetic.type`:** This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`client.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/client.md)
* [`http.request.header.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md)
* [`http.request.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`url.path`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`url.query`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`url.scheme`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`user_agent.original`](/docs/registry/attributes/user-agent.md)
