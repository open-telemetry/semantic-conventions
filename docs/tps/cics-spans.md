`tps.facility.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IPIC` | IP interconnectivity - IPIC provides access to CICS applications over the TCP/IP protocol | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `MRO` | Multiregion Operations - MRO enables CICS regions that are running in the same system, or in the same sysplex, to communicate with each other. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
