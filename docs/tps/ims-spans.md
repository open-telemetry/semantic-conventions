**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Defines server spans of IBM Information Management System (IMS) for z/OS.

**Span name** SHOULD be `{tps.system.name} {tps.transaction.id}`.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `SERVER`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**Attributes:**
