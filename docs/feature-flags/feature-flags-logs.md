# Semantic conventions for feature flags in logs

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for recording feature flag evaluations as
a [log record](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#log-and-event-record-definition) emitted through the
[Logger API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/logs/api.md#emit-a-logrecord).
This is useful when a flag is evaluated outside of a transaction context
such as when the application loads or on a timer.

## Motivation

Feature flags are commonly used in modern applications to decouple feature releases from deployments.
Many feature flagging tools support the ability to update flag configurations in near real-time from a remote feature flag management service.
They also commonly allow rulesets to be defined that return values based on contextual information.
For example, a feature could be enabled only for a specific subset of users based on context (e.g. users email domain, membership tier, country).

Since feature flags are dynamic and affect runtime behavior, it's important to collect relevant feature flag telemetry signals.
This can be used to determine the impact a feature has on a request, enabling enhanced observability use cases, such as A/B testing or progressive feature releases.

## Recording an Evaluation

Feature flag evaluations SHOULD be recorded as attributes on the
[LogRecord](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#log-and-event-record-definition) passed to the [Logger](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/logs/api.md#logger) emit
operations. Evaluations MAY be recorded on "logs" or "events" depending on the
context.

## Evaluation event

The table below indicates which attributes should be added to the
[LogRecord](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#log-and-event-record-definition) and their types.

The event name MUST be `feature_flag.evaluation`.

Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.

A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an application lifecycle. For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a flag each time a button is clicked. A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

| [`feature_flag.provider_name`](/docs/attributes-registry/feature-flag.md) | string | Identifies the feature flag provider. | `Flag Manager` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`feature_flag.set.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/feature-flag.md) | string | The identifier of the [flag set](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary/#flag-set) to which the feature flag belongs. | `proj-1`; `ab98sgs`; `service1/dev` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`feature_flag.version`](/docs/attributes-registry/feature-flag.md) | string | The version of the ruleset used during the evaluation. This may be any stable value which uniquely identifies the ruleset. | `1`; `01ABCDEF` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `error.type`:** If one of these values applies, then it MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `flag_not_found` | The flag could not be found. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `invalid_context` | The evaluation context does not meet provider requirements. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `parse_error` | An error was encountered parsing data, such as a flag configuration. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `provider_fatal` | The provider has entered an irrecoverable error state. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `provider_not_ready` | The value was resolved before the provider was initialized. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[2] `error.type`:** If and only if an error occurred during flag evaluation.

**[3] `feature_flag.variant`:** A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

**[4] `feature_flag.variant`:** If feature flag provider supplies a variant or equivalent concept.

**[5] `feature_flag.evaluation.error.message`:** If and only if an error occurred. It's NOT RECOMMENDED to duplicate the value of `error.type` in `feature_flag.evaluation.error.message`.
