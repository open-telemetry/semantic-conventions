## General Metrics

### Metric: `workflow.duration`

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `workflow.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Duration of the workflow grouped by by the definition and outcome. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |  |

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`workflow.definition.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | string | Name of the workflow | `Build and deploy application` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`workflow.outcome`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | string | The result of a task run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`workflow.trigger.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | string | Type of trigger that was called | `cron` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the workflow execution failed. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`host.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | string | Name of the host. On Unix systems, it may contain what the hostname command returns, or the fully qualified hostname, or another name specified by the user. | `opentelemetry-test` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`workflow.platform.product`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | string | The product being used to co-ordinate the execution of the tasks. | `k8s` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`container.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/container.md) | string | Container name used by container runtime. | `opentelemetry-autoconf` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`workflow.outcome` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | The task run was cancelled, eg. by a user manually cancelling the task run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `error` | The task run failed due to an error in the CICD system, eg. due to the worker being killed. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `failure` | The task run did not finish successfully, eg. due to a compile error or a failing test. Such failures are usually detected by non-zero exit codes of the tools executed in the task run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `skip` | The task run was skipped, eg. due to a precondition not being met. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `success` | The task run finished successfully. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `timeout` | A timeout caused the task run to be interrupted. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`workflow.platform.product` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
