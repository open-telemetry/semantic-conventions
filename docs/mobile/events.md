# Semantic Conventions for mobile events

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for instrumentations that emit
events on mobile platforms. All mobile events MUST use a namespace of
`device` in the `event.name` property.

## Lifecycle instrumentation

This section defines how to apply semantic conventions when instrumenting
application lifecycle. This event is meant to be used in conjunction with
`os.name` [resource semantic convention](/docs/resource/os.md) to identify the
mobile operating system (e.g. Android, iOS).

### iOS

<!-- semconv ios.lifecycle.events(full) -->
The event name MUST be `device.app.lifecycle`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`ios.state`](../attributes-registry/ios.md) | string | This attribute represents the state the application has transitioned into at the occurrence of the event. [1] | `active` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** The iOS lifecycle states are defined in the [UIApplicationDelegate documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate#1656902), and from which the `OS terminology` column values are derived.

`ios.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | The app has become `active`. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationDidBecomeActive`. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `inactive` | The app is now `inactive`. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillResignActive`. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `background` | The app is now in the background. This value is associated with UIKit notification `applicationDidEnterBackground`. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `foreground` | The app is now in the foreground. This value is associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillEnterForeground`. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `terminate` | The app is about to terminate. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillTerminate`. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

### Android

<!-- semconv android.lifecycle.events(full) -->
The event name MUST be `device.app.lifecycle`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`android.state`](../attributes-registry/android.md) | string | This attribute represents the state the application has transitioned into at the occurrence of the event. [1] | `created` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** The Android lifecycle states are defined in [Activity lifecycle callbacks](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#lc), and from which the `OS identifiers` are derived.

`android.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `created` | Any time before Activity.onResume() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.startService() has been called in the app for the first time. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `background` | Any time after Activity.onPause() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.stopService() has been called when the app was in the foreground state. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `foreground` | Any time after Activity.onResume() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.startService() has been called when the app was in either the created or background states. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
