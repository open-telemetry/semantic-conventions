## Click Events

### Event: `app.screen.click`

<!-- semconv event.app.screen.click -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `app.screen.click`.

This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.

The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event. This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided in absolute screen pixels.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.screen.coordinate.x`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.y`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Event: `app.widget.click`

<!-- semconv event.app.widget.click -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `app.widget.click`.

This event indicates that an application widget has been clicked.

Use this event to indicate that visual application component has been clicked, typically through a user's manual interaction.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.widget.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | An identifier that uniquely differentiates this widget from other widgets in the same application. [1] | `f9bc787d-ff05-48ad-90e1-fca1d46130b3`; `submit_order_1829` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.x`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.y`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.widget.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | The name of an application widget. [2] | `submit`; `attack`; `Clear Cart` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[2] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

## Jank Event

### Event: `app.jank`

Jank is a disruption in UI rendering, resulting in a display that can feel
sluggish or even unresponsive/frozen. Applications that are able to detect
jank can report it with the following events:

<!-- semconv event.app.jank -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `app.jank`.

This event indicates that the application has detected substandard UI rendering performance.

Jank happens when the UI is rendered slowly enough for the user to experience some disruption or sluggishness.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.jank.frame_count`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | int | A number of frame renders that experienced jank. [1] | `9`; `42` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.jank.period`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | double | The time period, in seconds, for which this jank is being reported. | `1.0`; `5.0`; `10.24` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.jank.threshold`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | double | The minimum rendering threshold for this jank, in seconds. | `0.016`; `0.7`; `1.024` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.jank.frame_count`:** Depending on platform limitations, the value provided MAY be approximation.

## Lifecycle instrumentation

This section defines how to apply semantic conventions when instrumenting
application lifecycle.

All mobile lifecycle events MUST use a namespace of `device` in the EventName LogRecord property.

### Event: `device.app.lifecycle`

<!-- semconv event.device.app.lifecycle -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `device.app.lifecycle`.

This event represents an occurrence of a lifecycle transition on Android or iOS platform.

The event body fields MUST be used to describe the state of the application at the time of the event.
This event is meant to be used in conjunction with `os.name` [resource semantic convention](/docs/resource/os.md) to identify the mobile operating system (e.g. Android, iOS).
The `android.app.state` and `ios.app.state` fields are mutually exclusive and MUST NOT be used together, each field MUST be used with its corresponding `os.name` value.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`android.app.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/android.md) | string | This attribute represents the state of the application. [1] | `created` | `Conditionally Required` if and only if `os.name` is `android` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`ios.app.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/ios.md) | string | This attribute represents the state of the application. [2] | `active`; `inactive`; `background` | `Conditionally Required` if and only if `os.name` is `ios` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `android.app.state`:** The Android lifecycle states are defined in [Activity lifecycle callbacks](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#lc), and from which the `OS identifiers` are derived.

**[2] `ios.app.state`:** The iOS lifecycle states are defined in the [UIApplicationDelegate documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate), and from which the `OS terminology` column values are derived.

---

`android.app.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `background` | Any time after Activity.onPause() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.stopService() has been called when the app was in the foreground state. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `created` | Any time before Activity.onResume() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.startService() has been called in the app for the first time. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `foreground` | Any time after Activity.onResume() or, if the app has no Activity, Context.startService() has been called when the app was in either the created or background states. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`ios.app.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | The app has become `active`. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationDidBecomeActive`. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `background` | The app is now in the background. This value is associated with UIKit notification `applicationDidEnterBackground`. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `foreground` | The app is now in the foreground. This value is associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillEnterForeground`. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `inactive` | The app is now `inactive`. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillResignActive`. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `terminate` | The app is about to terminate. Associated with UIKit notification `applicationWillTerminate`. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
