**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents an application screen first draw operation.

**Span name**: MUST be `app.screen.time_to_first_draw`.

**Span kind** MUST be `INTERNAL`.

This span captures the time from screen initialization to the first frame
of an application UI screen being drawn.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.screen.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | An identifier that uniquely differentiates this screen from other screens in the same application. [1] | `f9bc787d-ff05-48ad-90e1-fca1d46130b3`; `com.example.app.MainActivity`; `com.example.shop.ProductDetailFragment`; `MyApp.ProfileView`; `MyApp.ProfileViewController` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | The name of an application screen. [2] | `MainActivity`; `ProductDetailFragment`; `ProfileView`; `ProfileViewController` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | The type of UI management component or framework used to render and manage the screen's presentation and interactions. [3] | `swiftui`; `uikit`; `activity`; `fragment` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.screen.id`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[2] `app.screen.name`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[3] `app.screen.type`:** This attribute indicates which framework or structure is used to manage and display the screen’s content. For iOS, it may refer to either SwiftUI (declarative) or UIKit (imperative) for managing views. On Android, it can refer to either an Activity or a Fragment.

---

`app.screen.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `activity` | Android Activity (Android) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fragment` | Android Fragment (Android) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `swiftui` | SwiftUI View (iOS) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `uikit` | UIKit ViewController (iOS) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Time on screen span

<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span_kind captures the time that a screen was visible to the user, indicating the time between when the screen becomes visible and when it stops being visible.

**Span name:** MUST be `app.screen.time_on_screen`.

**Span kind** MUST be `INTERNAL`.

This span captures the screen's visibility, in seconds, meaning it includes only the time the screen is actively being shown to the user.
It does not include times when the app is in the background or when other screens/modal views are covering it. For example:
- **iOS**: From `viewDidAppear` to `viewWillDisappear`, indicating when the screen is first shown and when it's about to disappear.
- **Android**: From `onResume` to `onPause`, indicating when the screen comes to the foreground and when it goes to the background.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
