This span represents an application start operation.

**Span name:** MUST be `app.start`.

**Span kind** MUST be `INTERNAL`.

This span captures the time from user initiation (e.g., tapping the app icon or opening a link)
to the moment the app begins UI rendering.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.start.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | The type of application start, indicating the state of the app when it was initiated. | `cold`; `warm` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`app.start.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cold` | App start from terminated state [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `warm` | App start from background state [2] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** The app is started from a terminated state, meaning no prior instance of the app is running.

**[2]:** The app is started from the background, meaning an instance of the app is still in memory, but not active.
