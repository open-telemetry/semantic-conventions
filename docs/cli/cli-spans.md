# Semantic Conventions for CLI (Command Line Interface) programs

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions to apply when instrumenting CLI programs.
A CLI span is defined in terms of [process attributes][ProcessRegistry].

The **span name** SHOULD be of the format `{process.executable.name}`. In case this is
not informative enough because of interpreters calling other files, e.g. `python script.py` or in
cases of subcommands, e.g. `flask run mycommand` instrumentation MAY provide a more
descriptive span name providing a stringified version of `{process.command_args}` if appropriate.

> **Warning**
> The `process.command_args` value can have high cardinality in case of parameters passed by the user.
> It is recommended to strip parameters if there is enough domain knowledge for being able to do so.

Span status SHOULD be set to `Error` if `{process.exit.code}` is not 0.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`process.command_args`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string[] | All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`. | `["cmd/otecol", "--config=config.yaml"]` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`process.command_line`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`. Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use `process.command_args` instead. | `C:\cmd\otecol --config="my directory\config.yaml"` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`process.exit.code`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | int | The exit code of the program | `127` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
