To report host metrics, the `system.*` namespace SHOULD be used.

**type:** `host`

**Description:** A host is defined as a computing instance. For example, physical servers, virtual machines, switches or disk array.

**Attributes:**

| Role | Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other | [`host.arch`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The CPU architecture the host system is running on. | `amd64`; `arm32`; `arm64` |
| Other | [`host.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Unique host ID. For Cloud, this must be the instance_id assigned by the cloud provider. For non-containerized systems, this should be the `machine-id`. See the table below for the sources to use to determine the `machine-id` based on operating system. [1] | `fdbf79e8af94cb7f9e8df36789187052` |
| Other | [`host.image.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | VM image ID or host OS image ID. For Cloud, this value is from the provider. | `ami-07b06b442921831e5` |
| Other | [`host.image.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Name of the VM image or OS install the host was instantiated from. | `infra-ami-eks-worker-node-7d4ec78312`; `CentOS-8-x86_64-1905` |
| Other | [`host.image.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The version string of the VM image or host OS as defined in [Version Attributes](/docs/resource/README.md#version-attributes). | `0.1` |
| Other | [`host.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Name of the host. On Unix systems, it may contain what the hostname command returns, or the fully qualified hostname, or another name specified by the user. | `opentelemetry-test` |
| Other | [`host.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Type of host. For Cloud, this must be the machine type. | `n1-standard-1` |
| Other | [`host.ip`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string[] | Available IP addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces. [2] | `["192.168.1.140", "fe80::abc2:4a28:737a:609e"]` |
| Other | [`host.mac`](/docs/registry/attributes/host.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string[] | Available MAC addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces. [3] | `["AC-DE-48-23-45-67", "AC-DE-48-23-45-67-01-9F"]` |

**[1] `host.id`:** Collecting `host.id` from non-containerized systems

**Non-privileged Machine ID Lookup**

When collecting `host.id` for non-containerized systems non-privileged lookups
of the machine id are preferred. SDK detector implementations MUST use the
sources listed below to obtain the machine id.

| OS | Primary | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | contents of `/etc/machine-id` | contents of `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` |
| BSD | contents of `/etc/hostid` | output of `kenv -q smbios.system.uuid` |
| MacOS | `IOPlatformUUID` line from the output of `ioreg -rd1 -c "IOPlatformExpertDevice"` | - |
| Windows | `MachineGuid` from registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography` | - |

**Privileged Machine ID Lookup**

The `host.id` can be looked up using privileged sources. For example, Linux
systems can use the output of `dmidecode -t system`, `dmidecode -t baseboard`,
`dmidecode -t chassis`, or read the corresponding data from the filesystem
(e.g. `cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_id`,
`cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid`, etc), however, SDK resource
detector implementations MUST not collect `host.id` from privileged sources. If
privileged lookup of `host.id` is required, the value should be injected via the
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable.

**[2] `host.ip`:** IPv4 Addresses MUST be specified in dotted-quad notation. IPv6 addresses MUST be specified in the [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html) format.

**[3] `host.mac`:** MAC Addresses MUST be represented in [IEEE RA hexadecimal form](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf): as hyphen-separated octets in uppercase hexadecimal form from most to least significant.

**[1] `host.cpu.vendor.id`:** [CPUID](https://wiki.osdev.org/CPUID) command returns the vendor ID string in EBX, EDX and ECX registers. Writing these to memory in this order results in a 12-character string.
