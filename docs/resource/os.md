# Operating system

In case of virtualized environments, this is the operating system as it is observed by the process, i.e., the virtualized guest rather than the underlying host.

**type:** `os`

**Description:** The operating system (OS) on which the process represented by this resource is running.

In OpenTelemetry the OS namespace is used to describe the operating system of the host which is emitting the telemetry signals.

It is not used for the following scenarios:
- Describing the OS of the machine which is hosting the virtualised host when the telemetry relates to the virtualised host.
  E.g. when an application is running in a VM on a Windows host, the OS entity should describe the OS of the VM, not the Windows host.

- Describing the application runtime environment (e.g. JVM, WASM, etc.) as these machines are not classifed as host.
  E.g. when an application is running in a JVM on a Linux host, the OS entity should describe the Linux host, not the JVM.
  The process.runtime entity can be used to describe the JVM instead.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`os.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/os.md) | string | Human readable operating system name. | `iOS`; `Android`; `Ubuntu` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`os.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/os.md) | string | The operating system type. | `windows`; `unix` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`os.build_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/os.md) | string | Unique identifier for a particular build or compilation of the operating system. [1] | `TQ3C.230805.001.B2`; `20E247`; `22621` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`os.description`](/docs/registry/attributes/os.md) | string | Human readable (not intended to be parsed) OS version information, like e.g. reported by `ver` or `lsb_release -a` commands. | `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.778]`; `Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`os.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/os.md) | string | The version string of the operating system as defined in [Version Attributes](/docs/resource/README.md#version-attributes). | `14.2.1`; `18.04.1` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `os.build_id`:** `build_id` values SHOULD be obtained from the following sources:

| OS | Primary | Fallback |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Windows | `CurrentBuildNumber` from registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion` | - |
| MacOS | `ProductBuildVersion` from `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist` | `ProductBuildVersion` from `/System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist` |
| Linux | `BUILD_ID` from `/etc/os-release` | `BUILD_ID` from `/usr/lib/os-release`; <br> contents of `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`|

`os.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `unix` | Unix | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `windows` | Microsoft Windows [2] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[2]:** Used for the Windows NT Operating System.
