**[1] `process.args_count`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[2] `process.args_count`:** This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.

**[3] `process.command`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[4] `process.command_args`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[5] `process.command_line`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[6] `process.executable.name`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[7] `process.executable.path`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[8] `process.linux.cgroup`:** Control groups (cgroups) are a kernel feature used to organize and manage process resources. This attribute provides the path(s) to the cgroup(s) associated with the process, which should match the contents of the [/proc/\[PID\]/cgroup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html) file.

**[9] `process.title`:** In many Unix-like systems, process title (proctitle), is the string that represents the name or command line of a running process, displayed by system monitoring tools like ps, top, and htop.

### Selecting process attributes

At least one of the following attributes is required:

* [`process.executable.name`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.executable.path`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command_line`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command_args`](../registry/attributes/process.md)

Between `process.command_args` and `process.command_line`, usually `process.command_args` should be preferred.
On Windows and other systems where the native format of process commands is a single string,
`process.command_line` can additionally (or instead) be used.

`process.args_count` can be additional be provided or instead when sanitization of the arguments is not being performed.

How to set these attributes for particular runtime kinds is described in the following subsections.

In addition to these attributes, [`telemetry.sdk.language`](README.md#telemetry-sdk) can be used to determine the general kind of runtime used.

### Erlang runtimes

- `process.runtime.name` - The name of the Erlang VM being used, i.e., `erlang:system_info(machine)`.
- `process.runtime.version` - The version of the runtime (ERTS - Erlang Runtime System), i.e., `erlang:system_info(version)`.
- `process.runtime.description` - string | An additional description about the runtime made by combining the OTP version, i.e., `erlang:system_info(otp_release)`, and ERTS version.

Example:

| `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BEAM | 11.1 |  Erlang/OTP 23 erts-11.1 |

### Go runtimes

Go Runtimes SHOULD fill in the as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in an interpretation of Go's [`runtime.Compiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#Compiler) constant, according to the following rule:
  If the value is `gc`, fill in `go`. Otherwise, fill in the exact value of `runtime.Compiler`.

  This can be implemented with the following Go snippet:

  ```go
  import "runtime"

  func getRuntimeName() string {
    if runtime.Compiler == "gc" {
      return "go"
    }
    return runtime.Compiler
  }
  ```

- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the exact value returned by `runtime.Version()`, i.e. `go1.17`.
- `process.runtime.description` - Use of this field is not recommended.

Examples for some Go compilers/runtimes:

| `process.runtime.name` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `go` | Official Go compiler. Also known as `cmd/compile`. |
| `gccgo` | [gccgo](https://go.dev/doc/install/gccgo) is a Go [front end for GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html). |
| `tinygo` | [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) compiler. |

### Java runtimes

Java instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by copying from system properties.

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.name` as is
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.version` as is
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `java.vm.vendor`, `java.vm.name`, `java.vm.version`
  in that order, separated by spaces.

Examples for some Java runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |

| Android 11 | Android Runtime | 0.9 | The Android Project Dalvik 2.1.0 |

### JavaScript runtimes

JavaScript instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by copying from built-in runtime constants.

- `process.runtime.name`:
  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the constant value `nodejs`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the constant value `browser`.
- `process.runtime.version`:
  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the value of `process.versions.node`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the value of `navigator.userAgent`.

Examples for some JavaScript runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | nodejs | 14.15.4 |
| Web Browser | browser | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 |

### .NET runtimes

.NET instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by following values:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value by the name of runtime.
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `System.Environment.Version` for .NET,
  determine version based on the [registry values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed#query-the-registry-using-code)
  for .NET Framework
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription`.

`process.runtime.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value SHOULD be used, otherwise a custom value SHOULD be used.

- .NET Framework
- .NET
- .NET Core
- .NET Native

Examples for some .NET runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .NET Framework | .NET Framework | 4.8 | .NET Framework 4.8.9195.0 |
| .NET | .NET | 7.0.14 | .NET 7.0.14 |

### Python runtimes

Python instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` -
  Fill in the value of [`sys.implementation.name`][py_impl]
- `process.runtime.version` -
  Fill in the [`sys.implementation.version`][py_impl] values separated by dots.
  Leave out the release level and serial if the release level
  equals `final` and the serial equals zero
  (leave out either both or none).

  This can be implemented with the following Python snippet:

  ```python
  vinfo = sys.implementation.version
  result =  ".".join(map(
      str,
      vinfo[:3]
      if vinfo.releaselevel == "final" and not vinfo.serial
      else vinfo
  ))
  ```

- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the value of [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version) as-is.

[py_impl]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.implementation

Examples for some Python runtimes:

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPython 3.7.3 on Windows | cpython | 3.7.3 | 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 22:22:05) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] |
| CPython 3.13.1 on Linux | cpython | 3.13.1 | 3.13.1 (main, Dec  6 2024, 18:40:43) [Clang 18.1.8 ] |

Note that on CPython GCC/Clang Linux builds (up to and including 3.9) and PyPy, there is an actual newline in the `sys.version` string.
