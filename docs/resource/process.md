**[1] `process.args_count`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[2] `process.args_count`:** This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.

**[3] `process.command`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[4] `process.command_args`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[5] `process.command_line`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[6] `process.executable.name`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[7] `process.executable.path`:** See [Selecting process attributes](/docs/resource/process.md#selecting-process-attributes) for details.

**[8] `process.linux.cgroup`:** Control groups (cgroups) are a kernel feature used to organize and manage process resources. This attribute provides the path(s) to the cgroup(s) associated with the process, which should match the contents of the [/proc/\[PID\]/cgroup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html) file.

**[9] `process.title`:** In many Unix-like systems, process title (proctitle), is the string that represents the name or command line of a running process, displayed by system monitoring tools like ps, top, and htop.

### Selecting process attributes

At least one of the following attributes is required:

* [`process.executable.name`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.executable.path`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command_line`](../registry/attributes/process.md)
* [`process.command_args`](../registry/attributes/process.md)

Between `process.command_args` and `process.command_line`, usually `process.command_args` should be preferred.
On Windows and other systems where the native format of process commands is a single string,
`process.command_line` can additionally (or instead) be used.

`process.args_count` can be additional be provided or instead when sanitization of the arguments is not being performed.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- END AUTOGENERATED TEXT -->
<!-- endsemconv -->

How to set these attributes for particular runtime kinds is described in the following subsections.

In addition to these attributes, [`telemetry.sdk.language`](README.md#telemetry-sdk) can be used to determine the general kind of runtime used.

### Erlang runtimes

- `process.runtime.name` - The name of the Erlang VM being used, i.e., `erlang:system_info(machine)`.
- `process.runtime.version` - The version of the runtime (ERTS - Erlang Runtime System), i.e., `erlang:system_info(version)`.
- `process.runtime.description` - string | An additional description about the runtime made by combining the OTP version, i.e., `erlang:system_info(otp_release)`, and ERTS version.

Example:

| `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BEAM | 11.1 | Erlang/OTP 23 erts-11.1 |

### Go runtimes

Go Runtimes SHOULD fill in the as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in an interpretation of Go's [`runtime.Compiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#Compiler) constant, according to the following rule:
  If the value is `gc`, fill in `go`. Otherwise, fill in the exact value of `runtime.Compiler`.

  This can be implemented with the following Go snippet:

  ```go
  import "runtime"

  func getRuntimeName() string {
    if runtime.Compiler == "gc" {
      return "go"
    }
    return runtime.Compiler
  }
  ```

- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the exact value returned by `runtime.Version()`, i.e. `go1.17`.
- `process.runtime.description` - Use of this field is not recommended.

Examples for some Go compilers/runtimes:

| `process.runtime.name` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `go` | Official Go compiler. Also known as `cmd/compile`. |
| `gccgo` | [gccgo](https://go.dev/doc/install/gccgo) is a Go [front end for GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html). |
| `tinygo` | [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) compiler. |

### Java runtimes

Java instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by copying from system properties.

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.name` as is
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.version` as is
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `java.vm.vendor`, `java.vm.name`, `java.vm.version`
  in that order, separated by spaces.

Examples for some Java runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |

| Android 11 | Android Runtime | 0.9 | The Android Project Dalvik 2.1.0 |

### JavaScript runtimes

JavaScript instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by copying from built-in runtime constants.

- `process.runtime.name`:
  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the constant value `nodejs`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the constant value `browser`.
- `process.runtime.version`:
  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the value of `process.versions.node`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the value of `navigator.userAgent`.

Examples for some JavaScript runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | nodejs | 14.15.4 |
| Web Browser | browser | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 |

### .NET runtimes

.NET instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by following values:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value by the name of runtime.
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `System.Environment.Version` for .NET,
  determine version based on the [registry values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed#query-the-registry-using-code)
  for .NET Framework
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription`.

`process.runtime.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value SHOULD be used, otherwise a custom value SHOULD be used.

- .NET Framework
- .NET
- .NET Core
- .NET Native

Examples for some .NET runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .NET Framework | .NET Framework | 4.8 | .NET Framework 4.8.9195.0 |
| .NET | .NET | 7.0.14 | .NET 7.0.14 |

### Python runtimes

Python instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` -
  Fill in the value of [`sys.implementation.name`][py_impl]
- `process.runtime.version` -
  Fill in the [`sys.implementation.version`][py_impl] values separated by dots.
  Leave out the release level and serial if the release level
  equals `final` and the serial equals zero
  (leave out either both or none).

  This can be implemented with the following Python snippet:

  ```python
  vinfo = sys.implementation.version
  result =  ".".join(map(
      str,
      vinfo[:3]
      if vinfo.releaselevel == "final" and not vinfo.serial
      else vinfo
  ))
  ```

- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the value of [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version) as-is.

[py_impl]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.implementation

Examples for some Python runtimes:

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPython 3.7.3 on Windows | cpython | 3.7.3 | 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 22:22:05) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] |
| CPython 3.13.1 on Linux | cpython | 3.13.1 | 3.13.1 (main, Dec  6 2024, 18:40:43) [Clang 18.1.8 ] |

Note that on CPython GCC/Clang Linux builds (up to and including 3.9) and PyPy, there is an actual newline in the `sys.version` string.
