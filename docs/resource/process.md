**type:** `process`

**Description:** An operating system process.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`process.command`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`. | `cmd/otelcol` | `Conditionally Required` [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`process.command_args`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string[] | All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`. | `["cmd/otecol", "--config=config.yaml"]` | `Conditionally Required` [2] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`process.command_line`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`. Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use `process.command_args` instead. | `C:\cmd\otecol --config="my directory\config.yaml"` | `Conditionally Required` [3] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`process.executable.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The name of the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to the `Name` in `proc/[pid]/status`. On Windows, can be set to the base name of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`. | `otelcol` | `Conditionally Required` [4] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`process.executable.path`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The full path to the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to the target of `proc/[pid]/exe`. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`. | `/usr/bin/cmd/otelcol` | `Conditionally Required` [5] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`process.linux.cgroup`](/docs/attributes-registry/process.md) | string | The control group associated with the process. [6] | `1:name=systemd:/user.slice/user-1000.slice/session-3.scope`; `0::/user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/tmux-spawn-0267755b-4639-4a27-90ed-f19f88e53748.scope` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Selecting process attributes

At least one of the following attributes is required:

* [`process.executable.name`](../attributes-registry/process.md)
* [`process.executable.path`](../attributes-registry/process.md)
* [`process.command`](../attributes-registry/process.md)
* [`process.command_line`](../attributes-registry/process.md)
* [`process.command_args`](../attributes-registry/process.md)

Between `process.command_args` and `process.command_line`, usually `process.command_args` should be preferred.
On Windows and other systems where the native format of process commands is a single string,
`process.command_line` can additionally (or instead) be used.

How to set these attributes for particular runtime kinds is described in the following subsections.

In addition to these attributes, [`telemetry.sdk.language`](README.md#telemetry-sdk) can be used to determine the general kind of runtime used.

### Erlang Runtimes

- `process.runtime.name` - The name of the Erlang VM being used, i.e., `erlang:system_info(machine)`.
- `process.runtime.version` -  The version of the runtime (ERTS - Erlang Runtime System), i.e., `erlang:system_info(version)`.
- `process.runtime.description` - string | An additional description about the runtime made by combining the OTP version, i.e., `erlang:system_info(otp_release)`, and ERTS version.

Example:

| `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BEAM | 11.1 |  Erlang/OTP 23 erts-11.1 |

### Go Runtimes

Go Runtimes SHOULD fill in the as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in an interpretation of Go's [`runtime.Compiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#Compiler) constant, according to the following rule:
  If the value is `gc`, fill in `go`. Otherwise, fill in the exact value of `runtime.Compiler`.

  This can be implemented with the following Go snippet:

  ```go
  import "runtime"

  func getRuntimeName() string {
    if runtime.Compiler == "gc" {
      return "go"
    }
    return runtime.Compiler
  }
  ```

- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the exact value returned by `runtime.Version()`, i.e. `go1.17`.
- `process.runtime.description` - Use of this field is not recommended.

Examples for some Go compilers/runtimes:

| `process.runtime.name` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `go` | Official Go compiler. Also known as `cmd/compile`. |
| `gccgo` | [gccgo](https://go.dev/doc/install/gccgo) is a Go [front end for GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html). |
| `tinygo` | [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) compiler. |

### Java runtimes

Java instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by copying from system properties.

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.name` as is
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `java.runtime.version` as is
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `java.vm.vendor`, `java.vm.name`, `java.vm.version`
  in that order, separated by spaces.

  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the constant value `nodejs`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the constant value `browser`.
- `process.runtime.version`:
  - When the runtime is Node.js, fill in the value of `process.versions.node`.
  - When the runtime is Web Browser, fill in the value of `navigator.userAgent`.

Examples for some JavaScript runtimes

| Web Browser | browser | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 |

### .NET Runtimes

.NET instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values by following values:

- `process.runtime.name` - Fill in the value by the name of runtime.
- `process.runtime.version` - Fill in the value of `System.Environment.Version` for .NET,
  determine version based on the [registry values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed#query-the-registry-using-code)
  for .NET Framework
- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the values of `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription`.

`process.runtime.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value SHOULD be used, otherwise a custom value SHOULD be used.

- .NET Framework
- .NET
- .NET Core
- .NET Native

Examples for some .NET runtimes

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Python Runtimes

Python instrumentation SHOULD fill in the values as follows:

- `process.runtime.name` -
  Fill in the value of [`sys.implementation.name`][py_impl]
- `process.runtime.version` -
  Fill in the [`sys.implementation.version`][py_impl] values separated by dots.
  Leave out the release level and serial if the release level
  equals `final` and the serial equals zero
  (leave out either both or none).

  This can be implemented with the following Python snippet:

  ```python
  vinfo = sys.implementation.version
  result =  ".".join(map(
      str,
      vinfo[:3]
      if vinfo.releaselevel == "final" and not vinfo.serial
      else vinfo
  ))
  ```

- `process.runtime.description` - Fill in the value of [`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version) as-is.

[py_impl]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.implementation

Examples for some Python runtimes:

| Name | `process.runtime.name` | `process.runtime.version` | `process.runtime.description` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPython 3.7.3 on Windows | cpython | 3.7.3 | 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 22:22:05) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] |
