### CICD pipeline run

To efficiently set the following attributes for all spans of a pipeline run they should be defined as the following resource.

Since this resource is unique for each pipeline run, this means instantiating separate [TracerProviders](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#tracerprovider) for each pipeline run in order to be able to configure the resources of any spans emitted through that tracer.

Using the CICD pipeline run resource with metrics inherently causes high cardinality and may increase costs with some metric storage backends. Thus, using CICD pipeline run resource for metrics MUST be opt-in.

**Attributes:**

### CICD worker

<!-- semconv entity.cicd.worker -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `cicd.worker`

**Description:** A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).
A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Any OpenTelemetry signal associated with a worker should be associated to the worker that performed the corresponding work.
For example, when a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference the different `cicd.worker` resources corresponding to the workers that executed each task run. The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.

## Version Control System (VCS)

### VCS repository

<!-- semconv entity.vcs.repo -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `vcs.repo`

**Description:** A repository in the Version Control System.

> [!warning]
> This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

**Attributes:**

| Role | Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other | [`vcs.repository.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The human readable name of the repository. It SHOULD NOT include any additional identifier like Group/SubGroup in GitLab or organization in GitHub. [1] | `semantic-conventions`; `my-cool-repo` |
| Other | [`vcs.repository.url.full`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The [canonical URL](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10347851) of the repository providing the complete HTTP(S) address in order to locate and identify the repository through a browser. [2] | `https://github.com/opentelemetry/open-telemetry-collector-contrib`; `https://gitlab.com/my-org/my-project/my-projects-project/repo` |

**[1] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.

**[2] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

### VCS reference

<!-- semconv entity.vcs.ref -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `vcs.ref`

**Description:** A reference to a specific version in the Version Control System.

> [!warning]
> This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

**Attributes:**

| Role | Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other | [`vcs.ref.head.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The name of the [reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_ref) such as **branch** or **tag** in the repository. [1] | `my-feature-branch`; `tag-1-test` |
| Other | [`vcs.ref.head.revision`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The revision, literally [revised version](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revision), The revision most often refers to a commit object in Git, or a revision number in SVN. [2] | `9d59409acf479dfa0df1aa568182e43e43df8bbe28d60fcf2bc52e30068802cc`; `main`; `123`; `HEAD` |

**[1] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[2] `vcs.ref.head.revision`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
it is identical to the `ref.head.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

`vcs.ref.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `branch` | [branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefbranchabranch) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `tag` | [tag](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddeftagatag) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
