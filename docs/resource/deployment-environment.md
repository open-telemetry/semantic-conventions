**Description:** The software deployment.

> [!warning]
> This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

**Attributes:**

| Role | Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values | Configuration Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other | [`deployment.environment.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/deployment.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Name of the [deployment environment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment) (aka deployment tier). [1] | `staging`; `production` | `Opt-In` |

**[1] `deployment.environment.name`:** `deployment.environment.name` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
considered to be identifying the same service:

- `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=production`
- `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=staging`.

**Configuration File Options:**

| Setting | Requirement Level | Category | Example Value | Attribute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resource.experimentalresourcedetection.attributes.excluded[]` | `Conditionally Required` | Attribute Exclusion | `deployment.environment.name` | [`deployment.environment.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/.md) |
| `resource.attributes[]` | `Opt-In` | User Defined Resource | - name: deployment.environment.name,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:string,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value:  staging | [`deployment.environment.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/.md) |

**Environment Variable Options:**

| Setting | Requirement Level | Category | Example Value | Attribute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | Conditionally Required | User Defined Resource | `deployment.environment.name=staging` | [`deployment.environment.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/.md) |
