# Kubernetes

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

Useful resources to understand Kubernetes objects and metadata:

* [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
* [Names and UIDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/).
* [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
* [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/)

The "name" of a Kubernetes object is unique for that type of object within a
"namespace" and only at a specific moment of time (names can be reused over
time). The "uid" is unique across your whole cluster, and very likely across
time. Because of this it is recommended to always set the UID for every
Kubernetes object, but "name" is usually more user friendly so can be also set.

## Cluster

<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `k8s.cluster`

**Description:** A Kubernetes Cluster.

**Attributes:**

| Role | Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | [`k8s.cluster.uid`](/docs/registry/attributes/k8s.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace. [1] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` |
| Description | [`k8s.cluster.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/k8s.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The name of the cluster. | `opentelemetry-cluster` |

**[1] `k8s.cluster.uid`:** K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
`kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
rationale.

Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
`kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
UUIDs as standardized by
[ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
Which states:

> If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
> ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
> different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
> extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
conflict.

a namespace, but not across namespaces.

## Container

A container specification in a Pod template. This type is intended to be used to
capture information such as name of a container in a Pod template which is different
from the name of the running container.

Note: This type is different from [container](../container.md), which corresponds
to a running container.
