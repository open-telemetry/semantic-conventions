| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`device.manufacturer`](/docs/attributes-registry/device.md) | string | The name of the device manufacturer [1] | `Apple`; `Samsung` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`device.model.identifier`](/docs/attributes-registry/device.md) | string | The model identifier for the device [2] | `iPhone3,4`; `SM-G920F` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`device.model.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/device.md) | string | The marketing name for the device model [3] | `iPhone 6s Plus`; `Samsung Galaxy S6` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `device.manufacturer`:** The Android OS provides this field via [Build](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#MANUFACTURER). iOS apps SHOULD hardcode the value `Apple`.

**[2] `device.model.identifier`:** It's recommended this value represents a machine-readable version of the model identifier rather than the market or consumer-friendly name of the device.

**[3] `device.model.name`:** It's recommended this value represents a human-readable version of the device model rather than a machine-readable alternative.

**[4] `device.id`:** Its value SHOULD be identical for all apps on a device and it SHOULD NOT change if an app is uninstalled and re-installed.
However, it might be resettable by the user for all apps on a device.
Hardware IDs (e.g. vendor-specific serial number, IMEI or MAC address) MAY be used as values.
