# Resource semantic conventions

**Status**: [Mixed][DocumentStatus]

This document defines standard attributes for resources. These attributes are typically used in the [Resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) and are also recommended to be used anywhere else where there is a need to describe a resource in a consistent manner. The majority of these attributes are inherited from
[OpenCensus Resource standard](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-specs/blob/master/resource/StandardResources.md).

## TODOs

* Add more compute units: AppEngine unit, etc.
* Add Web Browser.
* Decide if lower case strings only.
* Consider to add optional/required for each attribute and combination of attributes
  (e.g when supplying a k8s resource all k8s may be required).

## Document Conventions

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus]

Attributes are grouped logically by the type of the concept that they described. Attributes in the same group have a common prefix that ends with a dot. For example all attributes that describe Kubernetes properties start with "k8s."

See [Attribute Requirement Levels](../general/attribute-requirement-level.md) for details on when attributes
should be included.

## Attributes with Special Handling

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus]

Given their significance some resource attributes are treated specifically as described below.

### Semantic Attributes with Dedicated Environment Variable

These are the attributes which MAY be configurable via a dedicated environment variable
as specified in [OpenTelemetry Environment Variable Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/configuration/sdk-environment-variables.md):

- [`service.name`](#service)

### Semantic Attributes with SDK-provided Default Value

These are the attributes which MUST be provided by the SDK
as specified in the [Resource SDK specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.41.0/specification/resource/sdk.md#sdk-provided-resource-attributes):

- [`service.name`](#service)
- [`telemetry.sdk` group](#telemetry-sdk)

**Status:** ![Mixed](https://img.shields.io/badge/-mixed-yellow)

**type:** `service`

**Description:** A service instance.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`service.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/service.md) | string | Logical name of the service. [1] | `shoppingcart` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`service.instance.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/service.md) | string | The string ID of the service instance. [2] | `627cc493-f310-47de-96bd-71410b7dec09` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`service.namespace`](/docs/attributes-registry/service.md) | string | A namespace for `service.name`. [3] | `Shop` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`service.version`](/docs/attributes-registry/service.md) | string | The version string of the service API or implementation. The format is not defined by these conventions. | `2.0.0`; `a01dbef8a` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `service.name`:** MUST be the same for all instances of horizontally scaled services. If the value was not specified, SDKs MUST fallback to `unknown_service:` concatenated with [`process.executable.name`](process.md), e.g. `unknown_service:bash`. If `process.executable.name` is not available, the value MUST be set to `unknown_service`.

**[2] `service.instance.id`:** MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
`service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
service).

Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
[`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
or not via another resource attribute.

For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
port.

**[3] `service.namespace`:** A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of services, for example the team name that owns a group of services. `service.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

<!-- endsemconv -->

Note: `service.namespace` and `service.name` are not intended to be concatenated for the purpose of forming a single globally unique name for the service. For example the following 2 sets of attributes actually describe 2 different services (despite the fact that the concatenation would result in the same string):

```
# Resource attributes that describes a service.
namespace = Company.Shop
service.name = shoppingcart
```

```
# Another set of resource attributes that describe a different service.
namespace = Company
service.name = Shop.shoppingcart
```

**Status:** ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen)

**type:** `telemetry.sdk`

**Description:** The telemetry SDK used to capture data recorded by the instrumentation libraries.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`telemetry.sdk.language`](/docs/attributes-registry/telemetry.md) | string | The language of the telemetry SDK. | `cpp`; `dotnet`; `erlang` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`telemetry.sdk.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/telemetry.md) | string | The name of the telemetry SDK as defined above. [1] | `opentelemetry` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`telemetry.sdk.version`](/docs/attributes-registry/telemetry.md) | string | The version string of the telemetry SDK. | `1.2.3` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `telemetry.sdk.name`:** The OpenTelemetry SDK MUST set the `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to `opentelemetry`.
If another SDK, like a fork or a vendor-provided implementation, is used, this SDK MUST set the
`telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to the fully-qualified class or module name of this SDK's main entry point
or another suitable identifier depending on the language.
The identifier `opentelemetry` is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this case.
All custom identifiers SHOULD be stable across different versions of an implementation.

## Version attributes

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus]

Version attributes, such as `service.version`, are values of type `string`. They are
the exact version used to identify an artifact. This may be a semantic version, e.g., `1.2.3`, git hash, e.g.,
`8ae73a`, or an arbitrary version string, e.g., `0.1.2.20210101`, whatever was used when building the artifact.

## Cloud-Provider-Specific Attributes

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

Attributes that are only applicable to resources from a specific cloud provider. Currently, these
resources can only be defined for providers listed as a valid `cloud.provider` in
[Cloud](./cloud.md) and below. Provider-specific attributes all reside in the `cloud-provider` directory.
Valid cloud providers are:

- [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/) (`alibaba_cloud`)
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) ([`aws`](cloud-provider/aws/README.md))
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) ([`gcp`](cloud-provider/gcp/README.md))
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) (`azure`)
- [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) (`tencent_cloud`)
- [Heroku dyno](./cloud-provider/heroku.md)
