# Google Cloud AppHub

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

These conventions are used by Google Cloud when using [AppHub](https://cloud.google.com/app-hub/docs/overview). Observability
data from Google Cloud will be annotated with these resource types, depending
on the source of telemetry. For example, metrics coming from a Google Cloud
service will be annotated with the appropriate `gcp.apphub.application` and
`gcp.apphub.service` as configured in AppHub.

See [Supported Resources](https://cloud.google.com/app-hub/docs/supported-resources) for what data will be annotated by Google Cloud.
