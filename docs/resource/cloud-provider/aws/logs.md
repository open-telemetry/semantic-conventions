| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other | [`aws.log.group.arns`](/docs/registry/attributes/aws.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string[] | The Amazon Resource Name(s) (ARN) of the AWS log group(s). [1] | `["arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/my/group:*"]` |
| Other | [`aws.log.group.names`](/docs/registry/attributes/aws.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string[] | The name(s) of the AWS log group(s) an application is writing to. [2] | `["/aws/lambda/my-function", "opentelemetry-service"]` |
| Other | [`aws.log.stream.arns`](/docs/registry/attributes/aws.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string[] | The ARN(s) of the AWS log stream(s). [3] | `["arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/my/group:log-stream:logs/main/10838bed-421f-43ef-870a-f43feacbbb5b"]` |

**[1] `aws.log.group.arns`:** See the [log group ARN format documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/iam-access-control-overview-cwl.html#CWL_ARN_Format).

**[2] `aws.log.group.names`:** Multiple log groups must be supported for cases like multi-container applications, where a single application has sidecar containers, and each write to their own log group.

**[3] `aws.log.stream.arns`:** See the [log stream ARN format documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/iam-access-control-overview-cwl.html#CWL_ARN_Format). One log group can contain several log streams, so these ARNs necessarily identify both a log group and a log stream.
