# System Semantic Conventions

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for systems (such as processes, runtimes, hardware, etc.).

System semantic conventions are defined for the following metrics:

* [System](system-metrics.md): For standard system metrics.
* [Hardware](hardware-metrics.md): For hardware-related metrics.
* [Process](process-metrics.md): For standard process metrics.
* [Runtime Environment](runtime-environment-metrics.md): For runtime environment metrics.
