# Session

## Session Attributes

Session is defined as the period of time encompassing all activities performed by the application and the actions executed by the end user.
Consequently, a Session is represented as a collection of Logs, Events, and Spans emitted by the Client Application throughout the Session's duration. Each Session is assigned a unique identifier, which is included as an attribute in the Logs, Events, and Spans generated during the Session's lifecycle.
When a session reaches end of life, typically due to user inactivity or session timeout, a new session identifier will be assigned. The previous session identifier may be provided by the instrumentation so that telemetry backends can link the two sessions.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="session-id" href="#session-id">`session.id`</a> | string | A unique id to identify a session. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="session-previous-id" href="#session-previous-id">`session.previous_id`</a> | string | The previous `session.id` for this user, when known. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
