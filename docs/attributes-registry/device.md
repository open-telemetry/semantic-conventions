## Device Attributes

Describes device attributes.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="device-id" href="#device-id">`device.id`</a> | string | A unique identifier representing the device [1] | `my_vendor:1234567890`; `imei:123456789012345`; `mac:01:23:45:67:89:AB` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="device-manufacturer" href="#device-manufacturer">`device.manufacturer`</a> | string | The name of the device manufacturer [2] | `Apple`; `Samsung` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="device-model-identifier" href="#device-model-identifier">`device.model.identifier`</a> | string | The model identifier for the device [3] | `iPhone3,4`; `SM-G920F` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="device-model-name" href="#device-model-name">`device.model.name`</a> | string | The marketing name for the device model [4] | `iPhone 6s Plus`; `Samsung Galaxy S6` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `device.id`:** **The `device.id` SHOULD NOT be used in most user-facing applications due to privacy regulations.
Consequently, instrumentations that provide it MUST provide it as an opt-in feature.**

Its value SHOULD be identical for all apps on a device and it SHOULD NOT change if an app is uninstalled and re-installed.
However, it might be resettable by the user for all apps on a device.
Hardware IDs (e.g. vendor-specific serial number, IMEI or MAC address) MIGHT be used as values.
The `device.id` SHOULD be prefixed with the type of the identifier and a colon separator (e.g. `imei:`).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[2] `device.manufacturer`:** The Android OS provides this field via [Build](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#MANUFACTURER). iOS apps SHOULD hardcode the value `Apple`.

**[3] `device.model.identifier`:** It's recommended this value represents a machine-readable version of the model identifier rather than the market or consumer-friendly name of the device.

**[4] `device.model.name`:** It's recommended this value represents a human-readable version of the device model rather than a machine-readable alternative.
