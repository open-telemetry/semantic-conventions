# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability

The vulnerability fields describe information about a vulnerability.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="vulnerability-category" href="#vulnerability-category">`vulnerability.category`</a> | string[] | The type of system or architecture that the vulnerability affects. These may be platform-specific (for example, Debian or SUSE) or general (for example, Database or Firewall). For example [Qualys vulnerability categories](https://qualysguard.qualys.com/qwebhelp/fo_portal/knowledgebase/vulnerability_categories.htm). | `["Firewall", "Database"]` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-classification" href="#vulnerability-classification">`vulnerability.classification`</a> | string | The classification of the vulnerability scoring system. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document). | `CVSS` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-description" href="#vulnerability-description">`vulnerability.description`</a> | string | The description of the vulnerability that provides additional context of the vulnerability. For example [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure CVE description](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs). | `A vulnerability in the firewall allows an attacker to bypass security controls.` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-enumeration" href="#vulnerability-enumeration">`vulnerability.enumeration`</a> | string | The type of identifier used for this vulnerability. For example, [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure CVE enumeration](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs). | `CVE`; `SNYK` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-id" href="#vulnerability-id">`vulnerability.id`</a> | string | A unique identification number for the vulnerability. For example, [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure CVE ID](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs). | `CVE-2021-44228`; `SNYK-JS-LODASH-567123` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-reference" href="#vulnerability-reference">`vulnerability.reference`</a> | string | A list of resources that provide additional information, context, and mitigations for the identified vulnerability. | `https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-report-id" href="#vulnerability-report-id">`vulnerability.report.id`</a> | string | The report or scan identification number. | `20191018.0001` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-scanner-vendor" href="#vulnerability-scanner-vendor">`vulnerability.scanner.vendor`</a> | string | The name of the scanner vendor that identified the vulnerability. | `Tenable` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-score-base" href="#vulnerability-score-base">`vulnerability.score.base`</a> | double | The base score of the vulnerability. [1] | `7.5` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-score-environmental" href="#vulnerability-score-environmental">`vulnerability.score.environmental`</a> | double | The environmental score of the vulnerability. [2] | `7.5` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-score-temporal" href="#vulnerability-score-temporal">`vulnerability.score.temporal`</a> | double | The temporal score of the vulnerability. [3] | `7.5` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-score-version" href="#vulnerability-score-version">`vulnerability.score.version`</a> | string | The version of the scoring system used to calculate the vulnerability score. | `3.0` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="vulnerability-severity" href="#vulnerability-severity">`vulnerability.severity`</a> | string | The severity of the vulnerability. | `Low`; `Medium`; `High` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `vulnerability.score.base`:** Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe. Base scores cover an assessment for exploitability metrics (attack vector, complexity, privileges, and user interaction), impact metrics (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and scope. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides qualitative severity rankings of "Low", "Medium", and "High" for CVSS v2.0 base score ranges in addition to the severity ratings for CVSS v3.0 as they are defined in the CVSS v3.0 specification.

**[2] `vulnerability.score.environmental`:** Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe. Environmental scores cover an assessment for any modified base metrics, confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

**[3] `vulnerability.score.temporal`:** Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe. Temporal scores cover an assessment for code maturity, remediation level, and confidence. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
