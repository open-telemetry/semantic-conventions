| <a id="url-subdomain" href="#url-subdomain">`url.subdomain`</a> | string | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain. In a partially qualified domain, or if the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. [8] | `east`; `sub2.sub1` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="url-template" href="#url-template">`url.template`</a> | string | The low-cardinality template of an [absolute path reference](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.2). | `/users/{id}`; `/users/:id`; `/users?id={id}` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="url-top-level-domain" href="#url-top-level-domain">`url.top_level_domain`</a> | string | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is `com`. [9] | `com`; `co.uk` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `url.domain`:** In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the domain field. If the URL contains a [literal IPv6 address](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2732#section-2) enclosed by `[` and `]`, the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the domain field.

**[2] `url.extension`:** The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. When the file name has multiple extensions `example.tar.gz`, only the last one should be captured `gz`, not `tar.gz`.

**[3] `url.full`:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.

**[4] `url.original`:** In network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.
`url.original` might contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case password and username SHOULD NOT be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD remain the same.

**[5] `url.path`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.path` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[6] `url.query`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.query` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`q=OpenTelemetry&sig=REDACTED`.

**[7] `url.registered_domain`:** This value can be determined precisely with the [public suffix list](http://publicsuffix.org). For example, the registered domain for `foo.example.com` is `example.com`. Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as `co.uk`.

**[8] `url.subdomain`:** The subdomain portion of `www.east.mydomain.co.uk` is `east`. If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as `sub2.sub1.example.com`, the subdomain field should contain `sub2.sub1`, with no trailing period.

**[9] `url.top_level_domain`:** This value can be determined precisely with the [public suffix list](http://publicsuffix.org).
