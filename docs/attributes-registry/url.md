| `url.subdomain`         | string | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.

| `url.top_level_domain`  | string | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is `com`. [9]                                                                                                                                  | `com`; `co.uk`                                                                  | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the domain field. If the URL contains a [literal IPv6 address](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2732#section-2) enclosed by `[` and `]`, the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the domain field.

**[2]:** The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. When the file name has multiple extensions `example.tar.gz`, only the last one should be captured `gz`, not `tar.gz`.

**[3]:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.
`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.
`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed). Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[4]:** In network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.
`url.original` might contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case password and username SHOULD NOT be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD remain the same.

**[5]:** Sensitive content provided in `url.path` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[6]:** Sensitive content provided in `url.query` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[7]:** This value can be determined precisely with the [public suffix list](http://publicsuffix.org). For example, the registered domain for `foo.example.com` is `example.com`. Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as `co.uk`.

**[8]:** The subdomain portion of `www.east.mydomain.co.uk` is `east`. If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as `sub2.sub1.example.com`, the subdomain field should contain `sub2.sub1`, with no trailing period.

**[9]:** This value can be determined precisely with the [public suffix list](http://publicsuffix.org).
