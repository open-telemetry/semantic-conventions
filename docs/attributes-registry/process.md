**[1]:** This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.

**[2]:** The process title (proctitle), sometimes the same as process name. It can also be different, for example, a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened.

**[3]:** The process ID within a PID namespace. This is not necessarily unique across all processes on the host but it is unique within the process namespace that the process exists within.
