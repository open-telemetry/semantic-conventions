# User Agent

## User-agent Attributes

Describes user-agent attributes.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="user-agent-name" href="#user-agent-name">`user_agent.name`</a> | string | Name of the user-agent extracted from original. Usually refers to the browser's name. [1] | `Safari`; `YourApp` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="user-agent-original" href="#user-agent-original">`user_agent.original`</a> | string | Value of the [HTTP User-Agent](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#field.user-agent) header sent by the client. | `CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3`; `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_7_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.2 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1`; `YourApp/1.0.0 grpc-java-okhttp/1.27.2` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| <a id="user-agent-synthetic-type" href="#user-agent-synthetic-type">`user_agent.synthetic.type`</a> | string | Specifies the category of synthetic traffic, such as tests or bots. [2] | `bot`; `test` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="user-agent-version" href="#user-agent-version">`user_agent.version`</a> | string | Version of the user-agent extracted from original. Usually refers to the browser's version [3] | `14.1.2`; `1.0.0` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `user_agent.name`:** [Example](https://www.whatsmyua.info) of extracting browser's name from original string. In the case of using a user-agent for non-browser products, such as microservices with multiple names/versions inside the `user_agent.original`, the most significant name SHOULD be selected. In such a scenario it should align with `user_agent.version`

**[2] `user_agent.synthetic.type`:** This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

**[3] `user_agent.version`:** [Example](https://www.whatsmyua.info) of extracting browser's version from original string. In the case of using a user-agent for non-browser products, such as microservices with multiple names/versions inside the `user_agent.original`, the most significant version SHOULD be selected. In such a scenario it should align with `user_agent.name`
