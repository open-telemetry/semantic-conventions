**[1]:** [Example](https://www.whatsmyua.info) of extracting browser's name from original string. In the case of using a user-agent for non-browser products, such as microservices with multiple names/versions inside the `user_agent.original`, the most significant name SHOULD be selected. In such a scenario it should align with `user_agent.version`
