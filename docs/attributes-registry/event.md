# Event

## Event Attributes

Attributes for Events represented using Log Records.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="event-name" href="#event-name">`event.name`</a> | string | Identifies the class / type of event. [1] | `browser.mouse.click`; `device.app.lifecycle` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `event.name`:** Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](/docs/general/attribute-naming.md). Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and kubernetes.
