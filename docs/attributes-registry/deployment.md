## Deployment Attributes

This document defines attributes for software deployments.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="deployment-environment-name" href="#deployment-environment-name">`deployment.environment.name`</a> | string | Name of the [deployment environment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment) (aka deployment tier). [1] | `staging`; `production` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="deployment-id" href="#deployment-id">`deployment.id`</a> | string | The id of the deployment. | `1208` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="deployment-name" href="#deployment-name">`deployment.name`</a> | string | The name of the deployment. | `deploy my app`; `deploy-frontend` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="deployment-status" href="#deployment-status">`deployment.status`</a> | string | The status of the deployment. | `failed`; `succeeded` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `deployment.environment.name`:** `deployment.environment.name` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
considered to be identifying the same service:

- `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=production`
- `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=staging`.

---

`deployment.status` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `failed` | failed | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `succeeded` | succeeded | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Deployment Deprecated Attributes

"Describes deprecated deployment attributes."

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="deployment-environment" href="#deployment-environment">`deployment.environment`</a> | string | 'Deprecated, use `deployment.environment.name` instead.' | `staging`; `production` | ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/-deprecated-red)<br>Deprecated, use `deployment.environment.name` instead. |
