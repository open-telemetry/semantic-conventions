# Destination

## Destination Attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="destination-address" href="#destination-address">`destination.address`</a> | string | Destination address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `destination.example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="destination-port" href="#destination-port">`destination.port`</a> | int | Destination port number | `3389`; `2888` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `destination.address`:** When observed from the source side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `destination.address` SHOULD represent the destination address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
