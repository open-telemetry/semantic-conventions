# Destination

## Destination Attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.

| Attribute             | Type   | Description                                                                                                                      | Examples                                               | Stability                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destination.address` | string | Destination address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `destination.example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `destination.port`    | int    | Destination port number                                                                                                          | `3389`; `2888`                                         | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** When observed from the source side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `destination.address` SHOULD represent the destination address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
