## VCS Repository Attributes

This group defines the attributes for [Version Control Systems (VCS)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="vcs-change-id" href="#vcs-change-id">`vcs.change.id`</a> | string | The ID of the change (pull request/merge request/changelist) if applicable. This is usually a unique (within repository) identifier generated by the VCS system. | `123` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `vcs.ref.base.name`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits.

**[2] `vcs.ref.base.revision`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits. The
revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
it is identical to the `ref.base.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

**[3] `vcs.ref.base.type`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits.

**[4] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[5] `vcs.ref.head.revision`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does

number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)

It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

**[6] `vcs.ref.head.type`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[7] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.

**[8] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

`vcs.change.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
