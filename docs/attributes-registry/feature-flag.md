# Feature Flag

## Feature Flag Attributes

This document defines attributes for Feature Flags.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="feature-flag-key" href="#feature-flag-key">`feature_flag.key`</a> | string | The unique identifier of the feature flag. | `logo-color` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-provider-name" href="#feature-flag-provider-name">`feature_flag.provider_name`</a> | string | The name of the service provider that performs the flag evaluation. | `Flag Manager` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-variant" href="#feature-flag-variant">`feature_flag.variant`</a> | string | SHOULD be a semantic identifier for a value. If one is unavailable, a stringified version of the value can be used. [1] | `red`; `true`; `on` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `feature_flag.variant`:** A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

A stringified version of the value can be used in situations where a
semantic identifier is unavailable. String representation of the value
should be determined by the implementer.
