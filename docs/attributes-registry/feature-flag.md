## Feature Flag Attributes

This document defines attributes for Feature Flags.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="feature-flag-context-id" href="#feature-flag-context-id">`feature_flag.context.id`</a> | string | The unique identifier for the flag evaluation context. For example, the targeting key. | `5157782b-2203-4c80-a857-dbbd5e7761db` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-evaluation-error-message" href="#feature-flag-evaluation-error-message">`feature_flag.evaluation.error.message`</a> | string | A message explaining the nature of an error occurring during flag evaluation. | `Flag `header-color` expected type `string` but found type `number`` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-evaluation-reason" href="#feature-flag-evaluation-reason">`feature_flag.evaluation.reason`</a> | string | The reason code which shows how a feature flag value was determined. | `static`; `targeting_match`; `error`; `default` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-key" href="#feature-flag-key">`feature_flag.key`</a> | string | The lookup key of the feature flag. | `logo-color` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-set-id" href="#feature-flag-set-id">`feature_flag.set.id`</a> | string | The identifier of the [flag set](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary/#flag-set) to which the feature flag belongs. | `proj-1`; `ab98sgs`; `service1/dev` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-system" href="#feature-flag-system">`feature_flag.system`</a> | string | Identifies the feature flag provider. | `Flag Manager` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-variant" href="#feature-flag-variant">`feature_flag.variant`</a> | string | A semantic identifier for an evaluated flag value. [1] | `red`; `true`; `on` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| <a id="feature-flag-version" href="#feature-flag-version">`feature_flag.version`</a> | string | The version of the ruleset used during the evaluation. This may be any stable value which uniquely identifies the ruleset. | `1`; `01ABCDEF` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `feature_flag.variant`:** A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

---

`feature_flag.evaluation.reason` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cached` | The resolved value was retrieved from cache. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `default` | The resolved value fell back to a pre-configured value (no dynamic evaluation occurred or dynamic evaluation yielded no result). | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `disabled` | The resolved value was the result of the flag being disabled in the management system. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `error` | The resolved value was the result of an error. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `split` | The resolved value was the result of pseudorandom assignment. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `stale` | The resolved value is non-authoritative or possibly out of date | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `static` | The resolved value is static (no dynamic evaluation). | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `targeting_match` | The resolved value was the result of a dynamic evaluation, such as a rule or specific user-targeting. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `unknown` | The reason for the resolved value could not be determined. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

## Deprecated Feature Flag Attributes

Describes deprecated Feature Flag attributes.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="feature-flag-provider-name" href="#feature-flag-provider-name">`feature_flag.provider_name`</a> | string | Deprecated, use `feature_flag.system` instead. | `Flag Manager` | ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/-deprecated-red)<br>Replaced by `feature_flag.system`. |
