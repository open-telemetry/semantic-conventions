The event name MUST be `browser.web_vital`.

This event describes the website performance metrics introduced by Google, See [web vitals](https://web.dev/vitals).

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).
