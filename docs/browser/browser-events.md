# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Event: `browser.web_vital`

<!-- semconv event.browser.web_vital -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.web_vital`.

This event describes the website performance metrics introduced by Google, See [web vitals](https://web.dev/vitals).

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `delta` | double | The delta between the current value and the last-reported value. See [delta](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals?tab=readme-ov-file#report-only-the-delta-of-changes). | `0.2` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `id` | string | A unique ID representing this particular metric instance. | `v3-1677874579383-6381583661209` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `name` | enum | Name of the web vital. | `cls` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `value` | double | Value of the web vital. | `1.0` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

`name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cls` | Cumulative Layout Shift. See [cls](https://web.dev/articles/cls). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fid` | First Input Delay. See [fid](https://web.dev/articles/fid). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `inp` | Interation to Next Paint. See [inp](https://web.dev/articles/inp). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Event: `browser.navigation`

<!-- semconv event.browser.navigation -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.navigation`.

This event represents a browser navigation action.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`browser.navigation.same_document`](/docs/registry/attributes/browser.md) | boolean | A boolean that is true if the navigation is within the same document [1] | `true`; `false` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`url.full`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [2] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv`; `//localhost` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`browser.navigation.hash_change`](/docs/registry/attributes/browser.md) | boolean | A boolean that is true if the navigation is a fragment navigation. [3] | `true`; `false` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`browser.navigation.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/browser.md) | string | The type of navigation [4] | `push`; `replace`; `reload`; `traverse` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `browser.navigation.same_document`:** This value is intended to be taken from the [Navigation API specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationDestination/sameDocument).

**[2] `url.full`:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.

**[3] `browser.navigation.hash_change`:** This value is intended to be taken from the [Navigation API specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigateEvent/hashChange).

**[4] `browser.navigation.type`:** The possible values are defined in the [Navigation API specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationActivation/navigationType).

---

`browser.navigation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `push` | A new location was navigated to, causing a new entry to be pushed onto the history list. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
