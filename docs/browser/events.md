# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Resource Timing Event

<!-- semconv event.browser.resource_timing -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.resource_timing`.

This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API. These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.

This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API. If the page starts unloading before the page loads, then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`browser.resource_timing.url.canonical`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The canonical URL of the resource, consisting of scheme, domain, and path. [1] | `https://www.example.com/path`; `https://cdn.example.com/assets/image.png`; `//localhost/api/resource` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.connect_end`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately after the browser finishes establishing the connection to the server to retrieve the resource, in milliseconds. See [connectEnd](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/connectEnd). | `476.6000000014906` |

See [connectStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/connectStart). | `476.6000000014901` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.domain_lookup_end`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately after the browser finishes the domain name lookup for the resource, in milliseconds. See [domainLookupEnd](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/domainLookupEnd). | `100.6000000014906` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.domain_lookup_start`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately before the browser starts the domain name lookup for the resource, in milliseconds. See [domainLookupStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/domainLookupStart). | `100.6000000014901` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.fetch_start`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately before the browser starts to fetch the resource, in milliseconds. See [fetchStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/fetchStart). | `9.600000000558794` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.request_start`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately before the browser starts requesting the resource from the server, cache, or local resource, in milliseconds. See [requestStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/requestStart). | `506.70000000298023` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.response_end`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately after the browser receives the last byte of the resource or immediately before the transport connection is closed, whichever comes first, in milliseconds. See [responseEnd](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/responseEnd). | `510.6000000014906` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.response_start`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately after the browser receives the first byte of the response from the server, cache, or local resource, in milliseconds. See [responseStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/responseStart). | `508.6000000014901` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.secure_connection_start`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately before the browser starts the handshake process to secure the current connection, in milliseconds. See [secureConnectionStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/secureConnectionStart). | `476.6000000014903` |
| [`browser.resource_timing.url.query`](attributes/.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string | The [URI query](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4) component of the resource URL. [2] | `size=large`; `format=webp`; `width=800&height=600` |

**[1] `browser.resource_timing.url.canonical`:** This is the canonical URL of the resource being measured, not the page URL. It represents the resource in its standard form for identification purposes. The canonical URL includes the scheme (if present), full domain, and path only. Query strings and credentials MUST be excluded to reduce cardinality and avoid capturing PII. For example, `https://www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d` would be captured as `https://www.example.com/path`. In JavaScript, this typically corresponds to `${url.origin}${url.pathname}` or `${location.protocol}//${location.host}${location.pathname}`.

**[2] `browser.resource_timing.url.query`:** This attribute is opt-in due to potential high cardinality and PII concerns. Sensitive content provided in the query string SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it. Use this attribute when query parameters are relevant to the resource being fetched (e.g., image dimensions, format specifications).
