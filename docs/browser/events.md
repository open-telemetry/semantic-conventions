# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Resource Timing Event

<!-- semconv event.browser.resource_timing -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.resource_timing`.

This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API. These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.

This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API. If the page starts unloading before the page loads, then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`url.full`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Required` | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [1] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv`; `//localhost` |

**[1] `url.full`:** Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials, and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example https://user:pwd@www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d would be sent as https://www.example.com/path by both removing any potential PII and reducing the cardinality of the name.

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Field Name | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |

| `requestStart` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately before the browser starts requesting the resource from the server, cache, or local resource, in milliseconds. See [requestStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/requestStart). | `506.70000000298023` |
| `responseEnd` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | double | The [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) immediately after the browser receives the last byte of the resource or immediately before the transport connection is closed, whichever comes first, in milliseconds. See [responseEnd](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/responseEnd). | `510.6000000014906` |
