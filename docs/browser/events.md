# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Event: `browser.web_vital`

<!-- semconv event.browser.web_vital -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.web_vital`.

This event describes the website performance metrics introduced by Google, See [web vitals](https://web.dev/vitals).

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `delta` | double | The delta between the current value and the last-reported value. See [delta](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals?tab=readme-ov-file#report-only-the-delta-of-changes). | `0.2` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `id` | string | A unique ID representing this particular metric instance. | `v3-1677874579383-6381583661209` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `name` | enum | Name of the web vital. | `cls` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `value` | double | Value of the web vital. | `1.0` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

`name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cls` | Cumulative Layout Shift. See [cls](https://web.dev/articles/cls). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fid` | First Input Delay. See [fid](https://web.dev/articles/fid). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `inp` | Interation to Next Paint. See [inp](https://web.dev/articles/inp). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `lcp` | Largest Contentful Paint. See [lcp](https://web.dev/articles/lcp). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Event: `browser.page_view`

<!-- semconv event.browser.page.view -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `browser.page.view`.

This event represents a browser page load/view.

The primary use case is to capture metrics about the number of views of a page. Page view can be a hard page load in a browser as well as virtual navigation in a SPA (single-page application). The event should be collected as soon as possible without waiting for potentially delayed data such as the Navigation timing browser API.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`browser.page_view.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/browser.md) | string | Type of navigation | `page_load`; `soft_navigation` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`url.full`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | string | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [1] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv`; `//localhost` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`browser.page.referrer_url`](/docs/registry/attributes/browser.md) | string | Referring Page URI ([document.referrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer)) whenever available. | `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `url.full`:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.

---

`browser.page_view.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `page_load` | Initial page load within the browser which will generally also precede a PageNavigationTiming event. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `soft_navigation` | This is for Single Page Applications (SPA) where the framework provides the ability to perform client side only page "navigation", the exact definition of what a virtual page change is determined by the SPA and the framework it is using. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
