**[1] `k8s.cluster.uid`:** K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
`kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
rationale.

Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
`kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
UUIDs as standardized by
[ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
Which states:

> If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
> ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
> different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
> extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
conflict.
