**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

-  when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))

- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

## Span AWS Client

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `CLIENT`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span describes an AWS SDK client call.

**Description:** **Span name** MUST be of the format `Service.Operation` as per the
AWS HTTP API, e.g., `DynamoDB.GetItem`, `S3.ListBuckets`. This is
equivalent to concatenating `rpc.service` and `rpc.method` with `.` and
consistent with the naming guidelines for RPC client spans.

AWS SDK span attributes are based on the request or response parameters
in AWS SDK API calls. The conventions have been collected over time based
on feedback from AWS users of tracing and will continue to increase as new
interesting conventions are found.

### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |

The attribute's value should adhere to the AWS Region codes outlined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html#available-regions).

**[15] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[16] `rpc.service`:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

---

`rpc.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

**[25] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function.
