# Faas


## Span Faas Client

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `CLIENT`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span represents an outgoing call to a FaaS service.

**Description:** The values reported by the client for the attributes listed below SHOULD be equal to
the corresponding [FaaS resource attributes][] and [Cloud resource attributes][],
which the invoked FaaS instance reports about itself, if it's instrumented.

### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.invoked_name`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The name of the invoked function. [1] | `my-function` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.invoked_provider`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The cloud provider of the invoked function. [2] | `alibaba_cloud`; `aws`; `azure` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.invoked_region`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The cloud region of the invoked function. [3] | `eu-central-1` | `Conditionally Required` [4] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `faas.invoked_name`:** SHOULD be equal to the `faas.name` resource attribute of the invoked function.

**[2] `faas.invoked_provider`:** SHOULD be equal to the `cloud.provider` resource attribute of the invoked function.

**[3] `faas.invoked_region`:** SHOULD be equal to the `cloud.region` resource attribute of the invoked function.

**[4] `faas.invoked_region`:** For some cloud providers, like AWS or GCP, the region in which a function is hosted is essential to uniquely identify the function and also part of its endpoint. Since it's part of the endpoint being called, the region is always known to clients. In these cases, `faas.invoked_region` MUST be set accordingly. If the region is unknown to the client or not required for identifying the invoked function, setting `faas.invoked_region` is optional.

---

`faas.invoked_provider` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `alibaba_cloud` | Alibaba Cloud | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `aws` | Amazon Web Services | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `azure` | Microsoft Azure | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `gcp` | Google Cloud Platform | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `tencent_cloud` | Tencent Cloud | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |


## Span Faas Datasource Server

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `SERVER`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span represents server side if the FaaS invocations triggered in response response to some data source operation such as a database or filesystem read/write.
### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.document.collection`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The name of the source on which the triggering operation was performed. For example, in Cloud Storage or S3 corresponds to the bucket name, and in Cosmos DB to the database name. | `myBucketName`; `myDbName` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.document.operation`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | Describes the type of the operation that was performed on the data. | `insert`; `edit`; `delete` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.document.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The document name/table subjected to the operation. For example, in Cloud Storage or S3 is the name of the file, and in Cosmos DB the table name. | `myFile.txt`; `myTableName` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.document.time`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | A string containing the time when the data was accessed in the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format expressed in [UTC](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). | `2020-01-23T13:47:06Z` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`faas.document.operation` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `delete` | When an object is deleted. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `edit` | When an object is modified. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `insert` | When a new object is created. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |


## Span Faas Server

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `SERVER`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span represents server (incoming) side of the FaaS invocation.
### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.trigger`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | Type of the trigger which caused this function invocation. [5] | `datasource`; `http`; `pubsub` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.coldstart`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | boolean | A boolean that is true if the serverless function is executed for the first time (aka cold-start). |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[5] `faas.trigger`:** For the server/consumer span on the incoming side,
`faas.trigger` MUST be set.

Clients invoking FaaS instances usually cannot set `faas.trigger`,
since they would typically need to look in the payload to determine
the event type. If clients set it, it should be the same as the
trigger that corresponding incoming would have (i.e., this has
nothing to do with the underlying transport used to make the API
call to invoke the lambda, which is often HTTP).

---

`faas.trigger` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `datasource` | A response to some data source operation such as a database or filesystem read/write | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `http` | To provide an answer to an inbound HTTP request | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `other` | If none of the others apply | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `pubsub` | A function is set to be executed when messages are sent to a messaging system | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `timer` | A function is scheduled to be executed regularly | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `SERVER`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span represents server side if the FaaS invocations triggered by a timer.
### Attributes:
