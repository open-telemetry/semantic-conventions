## Span Azure AI Inference Client

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `CLIENT`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** Semantic Conventions for [Azure AI Inference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/reference/reference-model-inference-api) client spans extend and override the semantic conventions for [Gen AI Spans](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md).

**Description:** `gen_ai.provider.name` MUST be set to `"azure.ai.inference"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}` when the
model name is available and `{gen_ai.operation.name}` otherwise.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[3] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

-  when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))

- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[4] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the output type requested by the client:
- `json` for structured outputs with defined or undefined schema
- `image` for image output
- `speech` for speech output
- `text` for plain text output

The attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
URL pointing to an image file.

Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
`gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[6] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `azure.resource_provider.namespace`:** When `azure.resource_provider.namespace` attribute is populated, it MUST be set to `Microsoft.CognitiveServices` for all operations performed by Azure AI Inference clients.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

## Span Azure Cosmosdb Client

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `CLIENT`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** Cosmos DB instrumentations include call-level spans that represent logical database calls and adhere to the general [Semantic Conventions for Database Client Spans](/docs/database/database-spans.md).

**Description:** Additional spans representing network calls may also be created depending on the connection mode (Gateway or Direct).
Semantic conventions described in this document apply to the call-level spans only.

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"azure.cosmosdb"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span name** SHOULD follow the general [database span name convention](/docs/database/database-spans.md#name)

**[11] `db.operation.name`:** The `db.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values.
If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used.

Batch operations:

- `execute_batch`

Bulk operations:

- `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
  [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations)).
  which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
- `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
  within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
  For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
  property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

- `delete_user_defined_function`
- `query_user_defined_functions`
- `read_all_user_defined_functions`
- `read_user_defined_function`

If none of them applies, it's RECOMMENDED to use language-agnostic representation of
client method name in snake_case. Instrumentations SHOULD document
additional values when introducing new operations.

**[12] `azure.cosmosdb.connection.mode`:** if not `gateway` (the default value is assumed to be `gateway`).

**[13] `azure.cosmosdb.operation.contacted_regions`:** Region name matches the format of `displayName` in [Azure Location API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/subscription/subscriptions/list-locations?view=rest-subscription-2021-10-01&tabs=HTTP#location)

**[14] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[15] `db.response.status_code`:** Response codes in the 4xx and 5xx range SHOULD be considered errors.

**[16] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[17] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[18] `azure.resource_provider.namespace`:** When `azure.resource_provider.namespace` attribute is populated, it MUST be set to `Microsoft.DocumentDB` for all operations performed by Cosmos DB client.

**[19] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[20] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[21] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.

**[22] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** If operation applies to a specific stored procedure.

**[23] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[24] `user_agent.original`:** The user-agent value is generated by SDK which is a combination of<br> `sdk_version` : Current version of SDK. e.g. 'cosmos-netstandard-sdk/3.23.0'<br> `direct_pkg_version` : Direct package version used by Cosmos DB SDK. e.g. '3.23.1'<br> `number_of_client_instances` : Number of cosmos client instances created by the application. e.g. '1'<br> `type_of_machine_architecture` : Machine architecture. e.g. 'X64'<br> `operating_system` : Operating System. e.g. 'Linux 5.4.0-1098-azure 104 18'<br> `runtime_framework` : Runtime Framework. e.g. '.NET Core 3.1.32'<br> `failover_information` : Generated key to determine if region failover enabled.
   Format Reg-{D (Disabled discovery)}-S(application region)|L(List of preferred regions)|N(None, user did not configure it).
   Default value is "NS".

**[25] `db.query.parameter.<key>`:** If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

Examples:

- For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
  the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

- For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(username)s;` with parameter
  `username = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.username` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

---

`azure.cosmosdb.connection.mode` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `direct` | Direct connection. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
