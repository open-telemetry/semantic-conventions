# HTTP


## Span HTTP Client

**Status:** ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen)

**Summary:** This span represents an outbound HTTP request.

**Description:** There are two ways HTTP client spans can be implemented in an instrumentation:

1. Instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt to send an HTTP request over the wire.
   In case the request is resent, the resend attempts MUST follow the [HTTP resend spec](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-request-retries-and-redirects).
   In this case, instrumentations SHOULD NOT (also) emit a logical encompassing HTTP client span.

2. If for some reason it is not possible to emit a span for each send attempt (because e.g. the instrumented library does not expose hooks that would allow this),
   instrumentations MAY create an HTTP span for the top-most operation of the HTTP client.
   In this case, the `url.full` MUST be the absolute URL that was originally requested, before any HTTP-redirects that may happen when executing the request.

**Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#name) section.

**Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

**Span status:** refer to the [Span Status](/docs/http/http-spans.md#status) section.

**[1] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[2] `server.address`:** In HTTP/1.1, when the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#name-request-target)
is passed in its [absolute-form](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-3.2.2),
the `server.address` SHOULD match the host component of the request target.

In all other cases, `server.address` SHOULD match the host component of the
`Host` header in HTTP/1.1 or the `:authority` pseudo-header in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

**[3] `server.port`:** In the case of HTTP/1.1, when the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#name-request-target)
is passed in its [absolute-form](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-3.2.2),
the `server.port` SHOULD match the port component of the request target.

In all other cases, `server.port` SHOULD match the port component of the
`Host` header in HTTP/1.1 or the `:authority` pseudo-header in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

**[4] `url.full`:** For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.

**[5] `error.type`:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[6] `http.request.method_original`:** If and only if it's different than `http.request.method`.

**[7] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[8] `network.protocol.name`:** If not `http` and `network.protocol.version` is set.

**[9] `http.request.resend_count`:** The resend count SHOULD be updated each time an HTTP request gets resent by the client, regardless of what was the cause of the resending (e.g. redirection, authorization failure, 503 Server Unavailable, network issues, or any other).

**[10] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[11] `http.request.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
  attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[12] `http.response.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all response headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.response.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `My-custom-header: abc, def` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.response.header.my-custom-header`
  attribute with value `["abc", "def"]` or `["abc, def"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[13] `network.transport`:** Generally `tcp` for `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, and `HTTP/2`. Generally `udp` for `HTTP/3`. Other obscure implementations are possible.

**[14] `url.template`:** The `url.template` MUST have low cardinality. It is not usually available on HTTP clients, but may be known by the application or specialized HTTP instrumentation.

**[15] `user_agent.synthetic.type`:** This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`http.request.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`url.full`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)

**[16] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[17] `url.path`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.path` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

**[18] `url.scheme`:** The scheme of the original client request, if known (e.g. from [Forwarded#proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded#proto), [X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto), or a similar header). Otherwise, the scheme of the immediate peer request.

**[19] `error.type`:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[20] `http.request.method_original`:** If and only if it's different than `http.request.method`.

**[21] `http.route`:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

**[22] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[23] `network.protocol.name`:** If not `http` and `network.protocol.version` is set.

**[24] `server.port`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).

**[25] `url.query`:** Sensitive content provided in `url.query` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the value `REDACTED`:

* [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
* [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
* [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

This list is subject to change over time.

When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
`q=OpenTelemetry&sig=REDACTED`.

**[26] `client.address`:** The IP address of the original client behind all proxies, if known (e.g. from [Forwarded#for](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded#for), [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For), or a similar header). Otherwise, the immediate client peer address.

**[27] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[28] `server.address`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).

**[29] `client.port`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.port` SHOULD represent the client port behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

**[30] `http.request.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
  attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[31] `http.response.header.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
Including all response headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
the HTTP library provides access to headers.

Examples:

- A header `Content-Type: application/json` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.response.content-type`
  attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
- A header `My-custom-header: abc, def` header SHOULD be recorded as the `http.response.header.my-custom-header`
  attribute with value `["abc", "def"]` or `["abc, def"]` depending on the HTTP library.

**[32] `network.transport`:** Generally `tcp` for `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, and `HTTP/2`. Generally `udp` for `HTTP/3`. Other obscure implementations are possible.

**[33] `user_agent.synthetic.type`:** This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`client.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/client.md)
* [`http.request.header.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md)
* [`http.request.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`url.path`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`url.query`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`url.scheme`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md)
* [`user_agent.original`](/docs/registry/attributes/user-agent.md)
