# GraphQL


## Span GraphQL Server

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Span kind:** `SERVER`

**Span status:** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.


**Summary:** This span represents an incoming operation on a GraphQL server implementation.

**Description:** **Span name** SHOULD be of the format `{graphql.operation.type}` provided
`graphql.operation.type` is available. If `graphql.operation.type` is not available,
the span SHOULD be named `GraphQL Operation`.

> **Warning**
> The `graphql.operation.name` value is provided by the client and can have high
> cardinality. Using it in the GraphQL server span name (by default) is
> NOT RECOMMENDED.
>
> Instrumentation MAY provide a configuration option to enable a more descriptive
> span name following `{graphql.operation.type} {graphql.operation.name}` format
> when `graphql.operation.name` is available.
