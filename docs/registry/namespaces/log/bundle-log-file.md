# Bundle Log File

## Log File Attributes

**Status:** Unknown stability.

**Summary:** Attributes for a file to which log was emitted.

**Description:** The following attributes do not describe entities that produce telemetry but rather, they describe mechanisms of log transmission.

### Attributes

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`log.file.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The basename of the file. | `audit.log` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.file.name_resolved`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The basename of the file, with symlinks resolved. | `uuid.log` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.file.path`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The full path to the file. | `/var/log/mysql/audit.log` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.file.path_resolved`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The full path to the file, with symlinks resolved. | `/var/lib/docker/uuid.log` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.record.original`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The complete original Log Record. [1] | `77 <86>1 2015-08-06T21:58:59.694Z 192.168.2.133 inactive - - - Something happened`; `[INFO] 8/3/24 12:34:56 Something happened` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.record.uid`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | A unique identifier for the Log Record. [2] | `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `log.record.original`:** This value MAY be added when processing a Log Record which was originally transmitted as a string or equivalent data type AND the Body field of the Log Record does not contain the same value. (e.g. a syslog or a log record read from a file.)

**[2] `log.record.uid`:** If an id is provided, other log records with the same id will be considered duplicates and can be removed safely. This means, that two distinguishable log records MUST have different values.
The id MAY be an [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier (ULID)](https://github.com/ulid/spec), but other identifiers (e.g. UUID) may be used as needed.
