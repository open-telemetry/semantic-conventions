## CICD Worker

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `cicd.worker`

**Description:** A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).
A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Any OpenTelemetry signal associated with a worker should be associated to the worker that performed the corresponding work.
For example, when a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference the different `cicd.worker` resources corresponding to the workers that executed each task run. The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.
