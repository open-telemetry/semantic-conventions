**[1] `aws.log.group.arns`:** See the [log group ARN format documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/iam-access-control-overview-cwl.html#CWL_ARN_Format).

**[2] `aws.log.group.names`:** Multiple log groups must be supported for cases like multi-container applications, where a single application has sidecar containers, and each write to their own log group.

**[3] `aws.log.stream.arns`:** See the [log stream ARN format documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/iam-access-control-overview-cwl.html#CWL_ARN_Format). One log group can contain several log streams, so these ARNs necessarily identify both a log group and a log stream.
