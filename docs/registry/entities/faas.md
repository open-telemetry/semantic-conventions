# Faas

## Faas Function

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `faas.function`

**Description:** A serverless function.

**Identifying Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.function.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The id of the single function that this runtime instance executes. [1] | `arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function`; `//run.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/services/SERVICE_ID`; `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The immutable version of the function being executed. [2] | `26`; `pinkfroid-00002` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `faas.function.id`:** On some systems/platforms, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
so it may be necessary to set `faas.function.id` as a span attribute instead.

The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

- **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
  Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
  [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
  with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
  multiple different aliases.
- **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
- **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
  *not* the function app, having the form
  `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
  This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
  a TracerProvider.

Should a provider not be listed above, another globally unique identifier should be used to identify the function.

**[2] `faas.version`:** Depending on the cloud provider and platform, use:

- **AWS Lambda:** The [function version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html)
  (an integer represented as a decimal string).
- **Google Cloud Run (Services):** The [revision](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/revisions)
  (i.e., the function name plus the revision suffix).
- **Google Cloud Functions:** The value of the
  [`K_REVISION` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var#runtime_environment_variables_set_automatically).
- **Azure Functions:** Not applicable. Do not set this attribute.

**Descriptive Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The name of the single function that this runtime instance executes. [3] | `my-function`; `myazurefunctionapp/some-function-name` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[3] `faas.name`:** This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
function (which may be stored in the
[`code.namespace`/`code.function.name`](/docs/general/attributes.md#source-code-attributes)
span attributes).

For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
(and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

- **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
  followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
  can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
  This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
  app can host multiple functions that would usually share
  a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).

**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`faas.instance`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | string | The execution environment ID as a string, that will be potentially reused for other invocations to the same function/function version. [4] | `2021/06/28/[$LATEST]2f399eb14537447da05ab2a2e39309de` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`faas.max_memory`](/docs/registry/attributes/faas.md) | int | The amount of memory available to the serverless function converted to Bytes. [5] | `134217728` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[4] `faas.instance`:** - **AWS Lambda:** Use the (full) log stream name.

**[5] `faas.max_memory`:** It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly. On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` provides this information (which must be multiplied by 1,048,576).
