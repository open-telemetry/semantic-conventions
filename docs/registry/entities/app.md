# App

## App

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `app`

**Description:** An app used directly by end users â€” like mobile, web, or desktop.

**Identifying Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.build_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | Unique identifier for a particular build or compilation of the application. | `6cff0a7e-cefc-4668-96f5-1273d8b334d0`; `9f2b833506aa6973a92fde9733e6271f`; `my-app-1.0.0-code-123` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | A unique identifier for the app. [1] | `com.domainname.applicationname` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | A namespace for `app.name`. [2] | `Shop` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | The version string of the app. The format is not defined by these conventions. | `2.0.0`; `a01dbef8a` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.id`:** MUST remain the same across all versions. For mobile applications this should correspond to the package id.

**[2] `app.namespace`:** A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of apps, for example the team name that owns a group of apps. `app.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `app.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `app.name` is expected to be unique for all apps that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

**Descriptive Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | Logical name of the app. [3] | `shoppingcart` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.roles`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string[] | What role this app can perform. [4] | `["ui", "background_tasks"]`; `["background_tasks"]` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | Describes the type of application which generated the telemetry | `console`; `device`; `service` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[3] `app.name`:** MUST be the same for all installations of the app.

**[4] `app.roles`:** This doesn't correspond to the roles being performed as a role can be disabled.
To discover the active roles you can look at `service.roles`

---

`app.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `console` | The application is interacted with via the console. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `device` | The application is interacted with via UI shown on the device the app is installed on. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `service` | The application runs in the backgroung without any ui. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `web` | The application is interacted with via a web browser. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## App Installation

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `app.installation`

**Description:** An instance of the app which has been installed on a device.

**Identifying Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.installation.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device [5] | `2ab2916d-a51f-4ac8-80ee-45ac31a28092` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[5] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**Descriptive Attributes:**

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | A unique identifier for the app. [6] | `com.domainname.applicationname` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/app.md) | string | A namespace for `app.name`. [7] | `Shop` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[6] `app.id`:** MUST remain the same across all versions. For mobile applications this should correspond to the package id.

**[7] `app.namespace`:** A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of apps, for example the team name that owns a group of apps. `app.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `app.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `app.name` is expected to be unique for all apps that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.
