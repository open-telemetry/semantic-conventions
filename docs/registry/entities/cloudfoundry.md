**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.app.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The guid of the application. [1] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `cloudfoundry.app.id`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.application_id`. This is the same value as
reported by `cf app <app-name> --guid`.

**[2] `cloudfoundry.app.name`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment

**[3] `cloudfoundry.org.id`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.org_id`. This is the same value as
reported by `cf org <org-name> --guid`.

**[4] `cloudfoundry.org.name`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.org_name`. This is the same value as
reported by `cf orgs`.

## CloudFoundry Process

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `cloudfoundry.process`

**Description:** The process of the application which is monitored.

**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.process.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The UID identifying the process. [5] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cloudfoundry.process.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The type of process. [6] | `web` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[5] `cloudfoundry.process.id`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.process_id`. It is supposed to be equal to
`VCAP_APPLICATION.app_id` for applications deployed to the runtime.
For system components, this could be the actual PID.

**[6] `cloudfoundry.process.type`:** CloudFoundry applications can consist of multiple jobs. Usually the
main process will be of type `web`. There can be additional background
tasks or side-cars with different process types.

## CloudFoundry Space

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `cloudfoundry.space`

**Description:** The space of the application which is monitored.

**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.space.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The guid of the CloudFoundry space the application is running in. [7] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[7] `cloudfoundry.space.id`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.space_id`. This is the same value as
reported by `cf space <space-name> --guid`.

**[8] `cloudfoundry.space.name`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.space_name`. This is the same value as
reported by `cf spaces`.

## CloudFoundry System

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**type:** `cloudfoundry.system`

**Description:** The system component which is monitored.

**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.
> Stable Entities MUST NOT have attributes without a defined role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.system.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | A guid or another name describing the event source. [9] | `cf/gorouter` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cloudfoundry.system.instance.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | A guid describing the concrete instance of the event source. [10] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[9] `cloudfoundry.system.id`:** CloudFoundry defines the `source_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
supposed to contain the component name, e.g. "gorouter", for
CloudFoundry components.

When system components are instrumented, values from the
[Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
should be used. The `system.id` should be set to
`spec.deployment/spec.name`.

**[10] `cloudfoundry.system.instance.id`:** CloudFoundry defines the `instance_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
supposed to contain the vm id for CloudFoundry components.

When system components are instrumented, values from the
[Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
should be used. The `system.instance.id` should be set to `spec.id`.
