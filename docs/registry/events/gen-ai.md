## Gen AI Assistant Message

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Event Name:** `gen_ai.assistant.message`

**Summary:** This event describes the assistant message passed to GenAI system.


### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.system`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [1] | `openai` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

---

`gen_ai.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
