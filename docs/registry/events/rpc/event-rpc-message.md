## RPC Message

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Event Name:** `rpc.message`

**Namespace:** [`rpc`](README.md)

**Summary:** Describes a message sent or received within the context of an RPC call.


**Description:** In the lifetime of an RPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on client and server spans SHOULD be created. In case of unary calls only one sent and one received message will be recorded for both client and server spans.

### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`rpc.message.compressed_size`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | int | Compressed size of the message in bytes. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | int | MUST be calculated as two different counters starting from `1` one for sent messages and one for received message. [1] |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | string | Whether this is a received or sent message. | `SENT`; `RECEIVED` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`rpc.message.uncompressed_size`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | int | Uncompressed size of the message in bytes. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `rpc.message.id`:** This way we guarantee that the values will be consistent between different implementations.
