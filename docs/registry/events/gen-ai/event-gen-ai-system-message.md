# Event Gen AI System Message

## Gen AI System Message

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Event Name:** `gen_ai.system.message`

**Namespace:** [`gen_ai`](README.md)

**Summary:** This event describes the system instructions passed to the GenAI model.


### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [1] | `openai`; `gcp.gen_ai`; `gcp.vertex_ai` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

`gen_ai.provider.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
