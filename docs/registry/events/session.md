# Session

## Session End

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Event Name:** `session.end`

**Summary:** Indicates that a session has ended.


**Description:** For instrumentation that tracks user behavior during user sessions, a `session.end` event SHOULD be emitted every time a session ends. When a session ends and continues as a new session, this event SHOULD be emitted prior to the `session.start` event.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`session.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | string | The ID of the session being ended. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Session Start

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Event Name:** `session.start`

**Summary:** Indicates that a new session has been started, optionally linking to the prior session.


**Description:** For instrumentation that tracks user behavior during user sessions, a `session.start` event MUST be emitted every time a session is created. When a new session is created as a continuation of a prior session, the `session.previous_id` SHOULD be included in the event. The values of `session.id` and `session.previous_id` MUST be different.
When the `session.start` event contains both `session.id` and `session.previous_id` fields, the event indicates that the previous session has ended. If the session ID in `session.previous_id` has not yet ended via explicit `session.end` event, then the consumer SHOULD treat this continuation event as semantically equivalent to `session.end(session.previous_id)` and `session.start(session.id)`.

### Attributes:
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`session.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | string | The ID of the new session being started. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`session.previous_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | string | The previous `session.id` for this user, when known. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | `Conditionally Required` [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `session.previous_id`:** If the new session is being created as a continuation of a previous session, the `session.previous_id` SHOULD be included in the event. The `session.id` and `session.previous_id` attributes MUST have different values.
