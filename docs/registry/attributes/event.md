## Event Attributes

Attributes for Events represented using Log Records.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Summary | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="event-name" href="#event-name">`event.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Identifies the class / type of event. [1] | `browser.mouse.click`; `device.app.lifecycle` |

**[1] `event.name`:** This attribute SHOULD be used by non-OTLP exporters when destination does not support `EventName` or equivalent field. This attribute MAY be used by applications using existing logging libraries so that it can be used to set the `EventName` field by Collector or SDK components.
