## Oracle Database Attributes

This section defines attributes for Oracle Database.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a id="oracle-db-domain" href="#oracle-db-domain">`oracle.db.domain`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The database domain associated with the connection. [1] | `example.com`; `corp.internal`; `prod.db.local` |
| <a id="oracle-db-instance-name" href="#oracle-db-instance-name">`oracle.db.instance.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The instance name associated with the connection in an Oracle Real Application Clusters environment. [2] | `ORCL1`; `ORCL2`; `ORCL3` |
| <a id="oracle-db-name" href="#oracle-db-name">`oracle.db.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The database name associated with the connection. [3] | `ORCL1`; `FREE` |
| <a id="oracle-db-pdb" href="#oracle-db-pdb">`oracle.db.pdb`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The pluggable database (PDB) name associated with the connection. [4] | `PDB1`; `FREEPDB` |
| <a id="oracle-db-service" href="#oracle-db-service">`oracle.db.service`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The service name currently associated with the database connection. [5] | `order-processing-service`; `db_low.adb.oraclecloud.com`; `db_high.adb.oraclecloud.com` |

**[1] `oracle.db.domain`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the `DB_DOMAIN` initialization parameter,
as exposed in `v$parameter`. `DB_DOMAIN` defines the domain portion of the global
database name and SHOULD be configured when a database is, or may become, part of a
distributed environment. Its value consists of one or more valid identifiers
(alphanumeric ASCII characters) separated by periods.

**[2] `oracle.db.instance.name`:** There can be multiple instances associated with a single database service. It indicates the
unique instance name to which the connection is currently bound. For non-RAC databases, this value
defaults to the `oracle.db.name`.

**[3] `oracle.db.name`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the parameter `DB_NAME` exposed in `v$parameter`.

**[4] `oracle.db.pdb`:** This attribute SHOULD reflect the PDB that the session is currently connected to.
If instrumentation cannot reliably obtain the active PDB name for each operation
without issuing an additional query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is
RECOMMENDED to fall back to the PDB name specified at connection establishment.

**[5] `oracle.db.service`:** The effective service name for a connection can change during its lifetime,
for example after executing sql, `ALTER SESSION`. If an instrumentation cannot reliably
obtain the current service name for each operation without issuing an additional
query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is RECOMMENDED to fall back to the
service name originally provided at connection establishment.
