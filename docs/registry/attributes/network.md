**[1] `network.connection.state`:** Connection states are defined as part of the [rfc9293](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293#section-3.3.2)

**[2] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[3] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[4] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[5] `network.type`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.
