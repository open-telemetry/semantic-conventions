## Workflow Attributes

Workflows seek to describe the execution of one ore more tasks to achieve an end result.
Workflows can be used to describe cicd, deployments, generic jobs or even cron jobs.

`workflow.execution.result` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | The task run was cancelled, eg. by a user manually cancelling the task run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `error` | The task run failed due to an error in the CICD system, eg. due to the worker being killed. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `failure` | The task run did not finish successfully, eg. due to a compile error or a failing test. Such failures are usually detected by non-zero exit codes of the tools executed in the task run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `skip` | The task run was skipped, eg. due to a precondition not being met. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `success` | The task run finished successfully. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `timeout` | A timeout caused the task run to be interrupted. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
