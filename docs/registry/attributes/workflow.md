# Workflow

## Workflow Attributes

Workflows seek to describe the execution of one ore more tasks to achieve an end result.
Workflows can be used to describe cicd, deployments, generic jobs or even cron jobs.

**[3] `workflow.iteration.count`:** Only used when the task is operating on batches.

**[4] `workflow.iteration.limit`:** Only used when the task is operating on batches or within a loop.

**[5] `workflow.task.annotation.<key>`:** The `<key>` being the annotation name, the value being the annotation value, even if the value is empty.
