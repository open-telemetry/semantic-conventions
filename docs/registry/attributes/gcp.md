## GCP Client Attributes

Attributes for Google Cloud client libraries.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-client-service" href="#gcp-client-service">`gcp.client.service`</a> | string | Identifies the Google Cloud service for which the official client library is intended. [5] | `appengine`; `run`; `firestore`; `alloydb`; `spanner` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[5] `gcp.client.service`:** Intended to be a stable identifier for Google Cloud client libraries that is uniform across implementation languages. The value should be derived from the canonical service domain for the service; for example, 'foo.googleapis.com' should result in a value of 'foo'.

## GCP - Google Cloud Run Attributes

This document defines attributes for Google Cloud Run.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-cloud-run-job-execution" href="#gcp-cloud-run-job-execution">`gcp.cloud_run.job.execution`</a> | string | The name of the Cloud Run [execution](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/job-executions) being run for the Job, as set by the [`CLOUD_RUN_EXECUTION`](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/container-contract#jobs-env-vars) environment variable. | `job-name-xxxx`; `sample-job-mdw84` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## GCP - Google Compute Engine (GCE) Attributes

This document defines attributes for Google Compute Engine (GCE).

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-gce-instance-hostname" href="#gcp-gce-instance-hostname">`gcp.gce.instance.hostname`</a> | string | The hostname of a GCE instance. This is the full value of the default or [custom hostname](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/custom-hostname-vm). | `my-host1234.example.com`; `sample-vm.us-west1-b.c.my-project.internal` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="gcp-gce-instance-name" href="#gcp-gce-instance-name">`gcp.gce.instance.name`</a> | string | The instance name of a GCE instance. This is the value provided by `host.name`, the visible name of the instance in the Cloud Console UI, and the prefix for the default hostname of the instance as defined by the [default internal DNS name](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns#instance-fully-qualified-domain-names). | `instance-1`; `my-vm-name` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## GCP Resource Attributes

Attributes for identifying GCP resources

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-resource-name" href="#gcp-resource-name">`gcp.resource.name`</a> | string | Fully-qualified resource name of the GCP resource being read, created, or modified [6] | `//somedomain.googleapis.com/projects/some-project/locations/us-central1/instances/12345` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[6] `gcp.resource.name`:** The attribute "gcp.resource.name" and the resource attribute "cloud.resource_id" are related but have different purposes. Use "cloud.resource_id" to identify the compute resource where the code is running. Use "gcp.resource.name" to identify the GCP resource that said code is manipulating. For example, if you have code that is running in Cloud Run and the code publishes to a topic in Cloud Pub/Sub, you should use "cloud.resource_id" to refer to the Cloud Run instance where the code is running, and you should use "gcp.resource.name" to identify The Cloud Pub/Sub topic to which your code is actively publishing.

## GCP Server Attributes

Attributes for Google Cloud servers.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-server-service" href="#gcp-server-service">`gcp.server.service`</a> | string | Identifies the Google Cloud service that is emitting the telemetry. [7] | `appengine`; `run`; `firestore`; `alloydb`; `spanner` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[7] `gcp.server.service`:** Server analogue of 'gcp.client.service'.

## Telemetry Control

Attributes for controlling telemetry behavior

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="gcp-project-id" href="#gcp-project-id">`gcp.project_id`</a> | string | Telemetry storage project. [8] | `my-project`; `other-project` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[8] `gcp.project_id`:** This attribute governs the destination project to which telemetry data should be routed. It may differ from the "consumer" project (used for quota, billing) or the "resource" project (the project containing the resource(s) on which the operation being reported was performed).
