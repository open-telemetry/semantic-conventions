| <a id="messaging-message-id" href="#messaging-message-id">`messaging.message.id`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | A value used by the messaging system as an identifier for the message, represented as a string. | `452a7c7c7c7048c2f887f61572b18fc2` |
| <a id="messaging-operation-name" href="#messaging-operation-name">`messaging.operation.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The system-specific name of the messaging operation. | `ack`; `nack`; `send` |
| <a id="messaging-operation-type" href="#messaging-operation-type">`messaging.operation.type`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | A string identifying the type of the messaging operation. [8] | `create`; `send`; `receive` |
| <a id="messaging-system" href="#messaging-system">`messaging.system`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The messaging system as identified by the client instrumentation. [9] | `activemq`; `aws.sns`; `aws_sqs` |

**[1] `messaging.batch.message_count`:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[2] `messaging.consumer.group.name`:** Semantic conventions for individual messaging systems SHOULD document whether `messaging.consumer.group.name` is applicable and what it means in the context of that system.

**[3] `messaging.destination.name`:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[4] `messaging.destination.subscription.name`:** Semantic conventions for individual messaging systems SHOULD document whether `messaging.destination.subscription.name` is applicable and what it means in the context of that system.

**[5] `messaging.destination.template`:** Destination names could be constructed from templates. An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id. Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for grouping and aggregation.

**[6] `messaging.message.body.size`:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed body size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
body size should be used.

**[7] `messaging.message.envelope.size`:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
size should be used.

**[8] `messaging.operation.type`:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[9] `messaging.system`:** The actual messaging system may differ from the one known by the client. For example, when using Kafka client libraries to communicate with Azure Event Hubs, the `messaging.system` is set to `kafka` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch sending scenarios. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `process` | One or more messages are processed by a consumer. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `send` | One or more messages are provided for sending to an intermediary. If a single message is sent, the context of the "Send" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
