## Source Attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the sender of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="source-address" href="#source-address">`source.address`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Source address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `source.example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| <a id="source-interface-id" href="#source-interface-id">`source.interface.id`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | int | Source Interface Id [2] | `10` |
| <a id="source-interface-name" href="#source-interface-name">`source.interface.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Source Interface Name [3] | `eth0` |
| <a id="source-mac" href="#source-mac">`source.mac`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Source mac address [4] | `AC-DE-48-23-45-67`; `AC-DE-48-23-45-67-01-9F` |
| <a id="source-port" href="#source-port">`source.port`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | int | Source port number | `3389`; `2888` |
| <a id="source-vlan-id" href="#source-vlan-id">`source.vlan.id`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | int | Source VLAN Id [5] | `10` |
| <a id="source-vlan-name" href="#source-vlan-name">`source.vlan.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Source VLAN Name [6] | `outside`; `DMZ`; `corporate` |
| <a id="source-zone" href="#source-zone">`source.zone`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Zone where traffic can be categorized as coming from [7] | `internal`; `External`; `DMZ`; `HR`; `Legal` |

**[1] `source.address`:** When observed from the destination side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `source.address` SHOULD represent the source address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `source.interface.id`:** Interface ID as reported by an observer (typically SNMP interface ID).

**[3] `source.interface.name`:** Interface name as reported by the system.

**[4] `source.mac`:** MAC Addresses MUST be represented in [IEEE RA hexadecimal form](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf): as hyphen-separated octets in uppercase hexadecimal form from most to least significant.

**[5] `source.vlan.id`:** VLAN ID as reported by the observer.

**[6] `source.vlan.name`:** VLAN name as reported by the observer.

**[7] `source.zone`:** Network zone of incoming traffic as reported by an observer to categorize the source area of the traffic.
