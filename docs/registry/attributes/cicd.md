# CICD

## CI/CD Pipeline Attributes

This group describes attributes specific to pipelines within a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system. A [pipeline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in this case is a series of steps that are performed in order to deliver a new version of software. This aligns with the [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pipeline) definition of a pipeline where a **pipeline** is the system for developing and producing something. In the context of CI/CD, a pipeline produces or delivers software.

**Attributes:**

| `available` | The worker is not performing work for the CICD system. It is available to the CICD system to perform work on (online / idle). [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `busy` | The worker is performing work for the CICD system. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `offline` | The worker is not available to the CICD system (disconnected / down). | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** Pipelines might have conditions on which workers they are able to run so not every worker might be available to every pipeline.
