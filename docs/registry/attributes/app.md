## Application Attributes

Describes attributes related to client-side applications (e.g. web apps or mobile apps).

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |

| <a id="app-jank-threshold" href="#app-jank-threshold">`app.jank.threshold`</a> | double | The minimum rendering threshold for this jank, in seconds. | `0.016`; `0.7`; `1.024` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-name" href="#app-name">`app.name`</a> | string | Logical name of the app. [4] | `shoppingcart` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| <a id="app-namespace" href="#app-namespace">`app.namespace`</a> | string | A namespace for `app.name`. [5] | `Shop` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-screen-coordinate-x" href="#app-screen-coordinate-x">`app.screen.coordinate.x`</a> | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-screen-coordinate-y" href="#app-screen-coordinate-y">`app.screen.coordinate.y`</a> | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-type" href="#app-type">`app.type`</a> | string | Describes the type of application which generated the telemetry | `console`; `device`; `service` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-version" href="#app-version">`app.version`</a> | string | The version string of the app. The format is not defined by these conventions. | `2.0.0`; `a01dbef8a` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| <a id="app-widget-id" href="#app-widget-id">`app.widget.id`</a> | string | An identifier that uniquely differentiates this widget from other widgets in the same application. [6] | `f9bc787d-ff05-48ad-90e1-fca1d46130b3`; `submit_order_1829` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="app-widget-name" href="#app-widget-name">`app.widget.name`</a> | string | The name of an application widget. [7] | `submit`; `attack`; `Clear Cart` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.id`:** MUST remain the same across all versions. For mobile applications this should correspond to the package id.

**[2] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[3] `app.jank.frame_count`:** Depending on platform limitations, the value provided MAY be approximation.

**[4] `app.name`:** MUST be the same for all installations of the app.

**[5] `app.namespace`:** A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of apps, for example the team name that owns a group of apps. `app.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `app.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `app.name` is expected to be unique for all apps that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

**[6] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[7] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

---

`app.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `console` | The application is interacted with via the console. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `device` | The application is interacted with via UI shown on the device the app is installed on. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `service` | The application runs in the backgroung without any ui. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `web` | The application is interacted with via a web browser. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
