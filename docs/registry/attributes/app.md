**[1] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[2] `app.jank.frame_count`:** Depending on platform limitations, the value provided MAY be approximation.

**[3] `app.screen.depth`:** Depth represents the screen's position in the screen hierarchy tree. The root screen of the app is considered to have a depth of 0. Screens that are nested within other screens (such as in tab navigation, modals, or multi-screen flows) will have increasing depth values (1, 2, etc.). For example, a modal screen that is presented over the root screen would have a depth of 1, while a screen inside a modal might have a depth of 2.

**[4] `app.screen.first_appear.duration`:** This measures the time, in nanoseconds, until the first pixels of the screen are drawn and the screen becomes visible to the user. It does not necessarily mean the screen is fully interactive or that dynamic content (like images, API responses, or animations) is fully loaded.

**[5] `app.screen.id`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[6] `app.screen.load.duration`:** This includes time, in nanoseconds, spent rendering the screen, waiting for dynamic content (if necessary), and ensuring the app is ready to process user input. The screen is considered "ready" once the UI is able to respond to user interactions such as taps, swipes, or gestures.

**[7] `app.screen.name`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[8] `app.screen.nodes`:** A "node" is any individual visual or interactive component contained within a screen. This includes UI elements like buttons, labels, text fields, images, containers, and static content such as images or text.

**[9] `app.screen.type`:** This attribute indicates which framework or structure is used to manage and display the screen’s content. For iOS, it may refer to either SwiftUI (declarative) or UIKit (imperative) for managing views. On Android, it can refer to either an Activity or a Fragment.

**[10] `app.screen.visible.duration`:** This attribute measures the duration during which the screen is visible and actively being displayed to the user. It begins when the screen becomes visible (e.g., `viewDidAppear` on iOS or `onResume` on Android) and ends when it is no longer visible (e.g., `viewWillDisappear` on iOS or `onPause` on Android). It does **not** include the time when the screen is in the background, nor does it account for time the screen may be obscured by other views or overlays (e.g., modals, popups, or other screens in split-view).

**[11] `app.start.duration`:** This is the time, in nanoseconds, between the user's initiation of the app start (e.g., tapping the app icon or opening a link) and the point when the app is fully ready for interaction, such as the main screen becoming visible or the app’s main functionality being accessible.

**[12] `app.start.type`:** Start types include:

- **Cold**: The app is started from a terminated state, meaning no prior instance of the app is running.
- **Warm**: The app is started from the background, meaning an instance of the app is still in memory, but not active.
- **Hot**: The app is already running and brought to the foreground, meaning no re-initialization is needed.
- **Pre-Warm**: The app started uses a pre-warmed process, meaning part of the app's initialization has already been done in anticipation of the start.

**[13] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[14] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.
