**[1] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[2] `app.jank.frame_count`:** Depending on platform limitations, the value provided MAY be approximation.

**[3] `app.screen.id`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[4] `app.screen.name`:** A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app. It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

**[5] `app.screen.time_on_screen.duration`:** This attribute measures the duration during which the screen is visible and actively being displayed to the user. It begins when the screen becomes visible (e.g., `viewDidAppear` on iOS or `onResume` on Android) and ends when it is no longer visible (e.g., `viewWillDisappear` on iOS or `onPause` on Android). It does **not** include the time when the screen is in the background, nor does it account for time the screen may be obscured by other views or overlays (e.g., modals, popups, or other screens in split-view).

**[6] `app.screen.time_to_first_draw.duration`:** This measures the time, in seconds, until the first frame of the screen is rendered and becomes visible to the user.

**[7] `app.screen.type`:** This attribute indicates which framework or structure is used to manage and display the screen’s content. For iOS, it may refer to either SwiftUI (declarative) or UIKit (imperative) for managing views. On Android, it can refer to either an Activity or a Fragment.

**[8] `app.start.duration`:** This is the time, in seconds, between the user's initiation of the app start (e.g., tapping the app icon or opening a link) and the point when the app is fully ready for interaction, such as the main screen becoming visible or the app’s main functionality being accessible.

**[9] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[10] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

`app.screen.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `activity` | Android Activity (Android) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `fragment` | Android Fragment (Android) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `swiftui` | SwiftUI View (iOS) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `uikit` | UIKit ViewController (iOS) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

`app.start.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cold` | App start from terminated state [11] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `warm` | App start from background state [12] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[11]:** The app is started from a terminated state, meaning no prior instance of the app is running.

**[12]:** The app is started from the background, meaning an instance of the app is still in memory, but not active.
