## System Memory Attributes

Describes System Memory attributes

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |

`system.memory.linux.slab.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reclaimable` | reclaimable | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `unreclaimable` | unreclaimable | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`system.memory.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `buffers` | buffers | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

| `used` | Actual used virtual memory in bytes. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** Calculation based on the operating system metrics. On Linux, this corresponds to "MemTotal - MemAvailable" from /proc/meminfo, which more accurately reflects memory in active use by applications compared to older formulas based on free, cached, and buffers. If MemAvailable is not available, a fallback to those older formulas may be used.
