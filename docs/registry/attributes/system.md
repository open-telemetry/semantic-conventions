---

`system.memory.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `buffers` | Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks. [2] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[2]:** Shouldn't get tremendously large (20 MB or so).

**[3]:** Doesn't include SwapCached.

**[4]:** Calculation based on the operating system metrics. On Linux, this corresponds to "LowFree + HighFree" from /proc/meminfo.

**[5]:** Calculation based on the operating system metrics. On Linux, this corresponds to "MemTotal - MemAvailable" from /proc/meminfo, which more accurately reflects memory in active use by applications compared to older formulas based on free, cached, and buffers. If MemAvailable is not available, a fallback to those older formulas may be used.
