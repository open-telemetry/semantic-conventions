**[1] `mcp.request.argument.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which arguments
are to be captured. Including all request arguments can be a security risk -
explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Value type SHOULD match the value of the argument as passed in the request.

Examples:

- A `param.location` argument with value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.request.argument.location` attribute with value `"Seattle, WA"`.
- A `param.a` argument with value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.request.argument.a` attribute with value `42`.
- A `param.complex` argument with value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.request.argument.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.

When the attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
by the OpenTelemetry implementation.

**[2] `mcp.resource.uri`:** This is a URI of the resource provided in the following requests or notifications: `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`, or `notifications/resources/updated`.
