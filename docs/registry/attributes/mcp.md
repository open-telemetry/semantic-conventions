[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io) attributes

**Attributes:**

| <a id="mcp-prompt-name" href="#mcp-prompt-name">`mcp.prompt.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The name of the prompt or prompt template provided in the request or response. | `analyze-code` |
| <a id="mcp-protocol-version" href="#mcp-protocol-version">`mcp.protocol.version`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The [version](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/versioning) of the Model Context Protocol used. | `2025-06-18` |
| <a id="mcp-request-id" href="#mcp-request-id">`mcp.request.id`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | This is a unique identifier for the request. | `42` |
| <a id="mcp-resource-uri" href="#mcp-resource-uri">`mcp.resource.uri`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The value of the resource uri. [2] | `postgres://database/customers/schema`; `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf` |
| <a id="mcp-response-result" href="#mcp-response-result">`mcp.response.result.<key>`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | template[any] | Result property returned in the response. `<key>` being the normalized result key (lowercase), the value being the result value. [3] | `{"output": "The weather is sunny."}`; `42`; `{"data": {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}}` |
| <a id="mcp-session-id" href="#mcp-session-id">`mcp.session.id`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Identifies MCP session. | `191c4850af6c49e08843a3f6c80e5046` |
| <a id="mcp-tool-name" href="#mcp-tool-name">`mcp.tool.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The name of the tool provided in the request. | `get-weather`; `execute_command` |

**[1] `mcp.input.param.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which keys
are to be captured. Including all request or notifications parameters
can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Value type SHOULD match the value of the parameter as passed in the request
or notification.

Examples:

In a params object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 12345,
  "method": "some/method",
  "params": {
    "location": "Seattle, WA",
    "a": 42,
    "complex": {"foo": "bar"}
  }
}
```

- A `param.location` key with string value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.input.param.location` attribute with string value `"Seattle, WA"`.
- A `param.a` key with integer value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.input.param.a`
  attribute with integer (signed 64 bit) value `42`.
- A `param.complex` key with complex value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.input.param.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.

The attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
by the OpenTelemetry implementation.

**[2] `mcp.resource.uri`:** This is a URI of the resource provided in the following requests or notifications: `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`, or `notifications/resources/updated`.

**[3] `mcp.response.result.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration to capture this attribute,
as response result can contain sensitive information.

Value type SHOULD match the value of the `result` object property as returned in the response.

Examples:

In a response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 12345,
  "result": {
    "location": "Seattle, WA",
    "a": 42,
    "complex": {"foo": "bar"}
  }
}
```

- A `location` key with value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.response.result.location` attribute with string value `"Seattle, WA"`.
- A `a` key with value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.response.result.a`
  attribute with integer (signed 64 bit) value `42`.
- A `complex` key with value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.response.result.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.

The attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
by the OpenTelemetry implementation.
