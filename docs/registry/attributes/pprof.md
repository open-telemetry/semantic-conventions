# Pprof

## Pprof specific attributes for the Profiling signal

Attributes specific to pprof that help convert from pprof to Profiling signal.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a id="pprof-location-is-folded" href="#pprof-location-is-folded">`pprof.location.is_folded`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | boolean | Provides an indication that multiple symbols map to this location's address, for example due to identical code folding by the linker. In that case the line information represents one of the multiple symbols. This field must be recomputed when the symbolization state of the profile changes. | |
| <a id="pprof-mapping-has-filenames" href="#pprof-mapping-has-filenames">`pprof.mapping.has_filenames`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | boolean | Indicates that there are filenames related to this mapping. | |
| <a id="pprof-mapping-has-functions" href="#pprof-mapping-has-functions">`pprof.mapping.has_functions`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | boolean | Indicates that there are functions related to this mapping. | |
| <a id="pprof-mapping-has-inline-frames" href="#pprof-mapping-has-inline-frames">`pprof.mapping.has_inline_frames`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | boolean | Indicates that there are inline frames related to this mapping. | |
| <a id="pprof-mapping-has-line-numbers" href="#pprof-mapping-has-line-numbers">`pprof.mapping.has_line_numbers`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | boolean | Indicates that there are line numbers related to this mapping. | |
| <a id="pprof-profile-comment" href="#pprof-profile-comment">`pprof.profile.comment`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string[] | Free-form text associated with the profile. This field should not be used to store any machine-readable information, it is only for human-friendly content. | `["hello world", "bazinga"]` |
| <a id="pprof-profile-doc-url" href="#pprof-profile-doc-url">`pprof.profile.doc_url`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Documentation link for this profile type. [1] | `http://pprof.example.com/cpu-profile.html` |
| <a id="pprof-profile-drop-frames" href="#pprof-profile-drop-frames">`pprof.profile.drop_frames`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Frames with Function.function_name fully matching the regexp will be dropped from the samples, along with their successors. | `/foobar/` |
| <a id="pprof-profile-keep-frames" href="#pprof-profile-keep-frames">`pprof.profile.keep_frames`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | Frames with Function.function_name fully matching the regexp will be kept, even if it matches drop_frames. | `/bazinga/` |

**[1] `pprof.profile.doc_url`:** The URL must be absolute and may be missing if the profile was generated by code that did not supply a link
