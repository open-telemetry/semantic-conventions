# Peer

## Peer Attributes

Operations that access some remote service.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="peer-service" href="#peer-service">`peer.service`</a> | string | The [`service.name`](/docs/resource/README.md#service) of the remote service. SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name` resource attribute of the remote service if any. [1] | `AuthTokenCache` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `peer.service`:** It MUST be possible to configure the peer service name in declarative configuration as follows:
- `peer` is host, and optionally the and path of the remote service that is used to identify the service
   instance, e.g., `example.com:443`, `1.2.3.4:8080`, `example.com`, `example.com:443/fooService`.
- `service` is the name of the remote service, e.g., `AuthService` that will be translated to the
  `peer.service` attribute.


```yaml
instrumentation/development:
  general:
    peer:
      service_mapping:
        - peer: 1.2.3.4
          service: FooService
        - peer: 2.3.4.5
          service: BarService
```
