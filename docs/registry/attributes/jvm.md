**[1] `jvm.buffer.pool.name`:** Pool names are generally obtained via [BufferPoolMXBean#getName()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.management/java/lang/management/BufferPoolMXBean.html#getName()).

**[2] `jvm.gc.action`:** Garbage collector action is generally obtained via [GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo#getGcAction()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.management/com/sun/management/GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo.html#getGcAction()).

**[3] `jvm.gc.cause`:** Garbage collector cause is generally obtained via [GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo#getGcCause()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.management/com/sun/management/GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo.html#getGcCause()).

**[4] `jvm.gc.name`:** Garbage collector name is generally obtained via [GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo#getGcName()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.management/com/sun/management/GarbageCollectionNotificationInfo.html#getGcName()).

**[5] `jvm.memory.pool.name`:** Pool names are generally obtained via [MemoryPoolMXBean#getName()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.management/java/lang/management/MemoryPoolMXBean.html#getName()).

`jvm.memory.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `heap` | Heap memory. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `non_heap` | Non-heap memory | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`jvm.thread.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |

| `blocked` | A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `new` | A thread that has not yet started is in this state. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `runnable` | A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `terminated` | A thread that has exited is in this state. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
