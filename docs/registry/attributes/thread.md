**[1] `thread.pool.name`:** If the thread is running on the pool but the name is not known, the name of `UNKNOWN` can be used to indicate that it is on the pool.

**[2] `thread.priority`:** This value should be as per it is obtained from the SDK/library being used. In the event both a numerical and a named value exists, the named value should be used as it provides meaningful context.

**[3] `thread.state`:** This is to be the value as received via api/sdk without transformation.
