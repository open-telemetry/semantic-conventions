## Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Attributes

This document defines attributes for remote procedure calls.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="rpc-connect-rpc-error-code" href="#rpc-connect-rpc-error-code">`rpc.connect_rpc.error_code`</a> | string | The [error codes](https://connectrpc.com//docs/protocol/#error-codes) of the Connect request. Error codes are always string values. | `cancelled`; `unknown`; `invalid_argument` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="rpc-connect-rpc-request-metadata" href="#rpc-connect-rpc-request-metadata">`rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.<key>`</a> | string[] | Connect request metadata, `<key>` being the normalized Connect Metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values. [1] | `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="rpc-connect-rpc-response-metadata" href="#rpc-connect-rpc-response-metadata">`rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.<key>`</a> | string[] | Connect response metadata, `<key>` being the normalized Connect Metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values. [2] | `["attribute_value"]` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

| <a id="rpc-jsonrpc-request-id" href="#rpc-jsonrpc-request-id">`rpc.jsonrpc.request_id`</a> | string | `id` property of request or response.

| <a id="rpc-jsonrpc-version" href="#rpc-jsonrpc-version">`rpc.jsonrpc.version`</a> | string | Protocol version as in `jsonrpc` property of request/response.

**[1] `rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.connect_rpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`

**[2] `rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all response metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `"attribute_value"` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.connect_rpc.response.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["attribute_value"]`

**[3] `rpc.grpc.request.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
`rpc.grpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`

**[4] `rpc.grpc.response.metadata.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
Including all response metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["attribute_value"]` SHOULD be recorded as
the `rpc.grpc.response.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["attribute_value"]`

**[5] `rpc.message.id`:** This way we guarantee that the values will be consistent between different implementations.
