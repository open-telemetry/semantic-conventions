## OTel Component Attributes

Attributes used for OpenTelemetry component self-monitoring

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a id="otel-component-name" href="#otel-component-name">`otel.component.name`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [1] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| <a id="otel-component-type" href="#otel-component-type">`otel.component.type`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [2] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |

**[1] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[2] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

## OTel Event Attributes

Attributes used by non-OTLP exporters to represent OpenTelemetry Event's concepts.

**Attributes:**

**[3] `otel.event.name`:** This attribute SHOULD be used by non-OTLP exporters when destination does not support `EventName` or equivalent field. This attribute MAY be used by applications using existing logging libraries so that it can be used to set the `EventName` field by Collector or SDK components.
