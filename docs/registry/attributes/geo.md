# Geo

## Geo Attributes

Geo fields can carry data about a specific location related to an event. This geolocation information can be derived from techniques such as Geo IP, or be user-supplied.
Note: Geo attributes are typically used under another namespace, such as client.* and describe the location of the corresponding entity (device, end-user, etc). Semantic conventions that reference geo attributes (as a root namespace) or embed them (under their own namespace) SHOULD document what geo attributes describe in the scope of that convention.

**Attributes:**
