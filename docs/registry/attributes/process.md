## Process Attributes

An operating system process.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a id="process-args-count" href="#process-args-count">`process.args_count`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | int | Length of the process.command_args array [1] | `4` |
| <a id="process-command" href="#process-command">`process.command`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string | The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`. | `cmd/otelcol` |
| <a id="process-command-args" href="#process-command-args">`process.command_args`</a> | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | string[] | All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`. SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data. | `["cmd/otecol", "--config=config.yaml"]` |

**[1] `process.args_count`:** This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.

**[2] `process.environment_variable.<key>`:** Examples:

- an environment variable `USER` with value `"ubuntu"` SHOULD be recorded
as the `process.environment_variable.USER` attribute with value `"ubuntu"`.

- an environment variable `PATH` with value `"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"`
SHOULD be recorded as the `process.environment_variable.PATH` attribute
with value `"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"`.

**[3] `process.title`:** In many Unix-like systems, process title (proctitle), is the string that represents the name or command line of a running process, displayed by system monitoring tools like ps, top, and htop.

**[4] `process.vpid`:** The process ID within a PID namespace. This is not necessarily unique across all processes on the host but it is unique within the process namespace that the process exists within.
