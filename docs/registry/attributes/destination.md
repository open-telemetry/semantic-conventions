# Destination

## Destination Attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="destination-address" href="#destination-address">`destination.address`</a> | string | Destination address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `destination.example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-interface-id" href="#destination-interface-id">`destination.interface.id`</a> | int | Destination Interface Id [2] | `10` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-interface-name" href="#destination-interface-name">`destination.interface.name`</a> | string | Destination Interface Name [3] | `eth0` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-mac" href="#destination-mac">`destination.mac`</a> | string | Destination mac address [4] | `AC-DE-48-23-45-67`; `AC-DE-48-23-45-67-01-9F` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-port" href="#destination-port">`destination.port`</a> | int | Destination port number | `3389`; `2888` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-vlan-id" href="#destination-vlan-id">`destination.vlan.id`</a> | int | Destination VLAN Id [5] | `10` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-vlan-name" href="#destination-vlan-name">`destination.vlan.name`</a> | string | Destination VLAN Name [6] | `outside`; `DMZ`; `corporate` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="destination-zone" href="#destination-zone">`destination.zone`</a> | string | Zone where traffic can be categorized as going to [7] | `internal`; `External`; `DMZ`; `HR`; `Legal` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `destination.address`:** When observed from the source side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `destination.address` SHOULD represent the destination address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `destination.interface.id`:** Interface ID as reported by an observer (typically SNMP interface ID).

**[3] `destination.interface.name`:** Interface name as reported by the system.

**[4] `destination.mac`:** MAC Addresses MUST be represented in [IEEE RA hexadecimal form](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf): as hyphen-separated octets in uppercase hexadecimal form from most to least significant.

**[5] `destination.vlan.id`:** VLAN ID as reported by the observer.

**[6] `destination.vlan.name`:** VLAN name as reported by the observer.

**[7] `destination.zone`:** Network zone of outgoing traffic as reported by an observer to categorize the destination area of the traffic.
