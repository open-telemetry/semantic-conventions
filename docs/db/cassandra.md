# Semantic conventions for Cassandra client operations

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

<!-- toc -->

- [Spans](#spans)
- [Metrics](#metrics)

<!-- tocstop -->

The Semantic Conventions for [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

<!-- semconv span.db.cassandra.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Spans representing calls to a Cassandra database adhere to the general [Semantic Conventions for Database Client Spans](/docs/db/database-spans.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"cassandra"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span name** SHOULD follow the general [database span name convention](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name)

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[3] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[4] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
in non-batch operations.

If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[6] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** All Cassandra protocol error codes SHOULD be considered errors.

**[8] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[9] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[10] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[11] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
calls involving complex queries.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
[Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[14] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).

**[15] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[16] `network.peer.address`:** If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[17] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[18] `db.query.parameter.<key>`:** If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

Examples:

- For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
  the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

- For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
  `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

## Metrics

Cassandra client instrumentations SHOULD collect metrics according to the general
[Semantic Conventions for Database Client Metrics](database-metrics.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"cassandra"`.
