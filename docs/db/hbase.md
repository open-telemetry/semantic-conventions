# Semantic conventions for HBase client operations

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

<!-- toc -->

- [Spans](#spans)
- [Metrics](#metrics)

<!-- tocstop -->

The Semantic Conventions for [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) extend and override the [Database Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

<!-- semconv span.db.hbase.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Spans representing calls to an HBase database adhere to the general [Semantic Conventions for Database Client Spans](/docs/db/database-spans.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"hbase"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span name** SHOULD follow the general [database span name convention](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name)

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Required` | string | The name of the operation or command being executed. [1] | `findAndModify`; `HMSET`; `SELECT` |
| [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | string | The HBase table name. [2] | `mytable`; `ns:table` |
| [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | string | The HBase namespace. [3] | `mynamespace` |
| [`db.response.status_code`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If response was received. | string | Protocol-specific response code recorded as a string. [4] | `200`; `409`; `14` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the operation failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [5] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` [6] | int | Server port number. [7] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`db.operation.batch.size`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | int | The number of queries included in a batch operation. [8] | `2`; `3`; `4` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Name of the database host. [9] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |

**[1] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH`.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization. If table name includes the namespace, the `db.collection.name` SHOULD be set to the full table name.

**[3] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[4] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

**[5] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[6] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[9] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Metrics

HBase client instrumentations SHOULD collect metrics according to the general
[Semantic Conventions for Database Client Metrics](database-metrics.md).

`db.system.name` MUST be set to `"hbase"`.
