## Database operation

### Metric: `db.client.operation.duration`

**Status**: [Stable][DocumentStatus]

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

When this metric is reported alongside a database operation span, the metric value SHOULD be the same as the database operation span duration.

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.53.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ]`.

**[1] `db.system.name`:** The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.

**[3] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
in non-batch operations.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[4] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call.

**[6] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
in non-batch operations.

If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[8] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

**[9] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[10] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[11] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[12] `db.query.summary`:** if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
calls involving complex queries.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
[Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[14] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** If operation applies to a specific stored procedure.

**[15] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.

**[16] `network.peer.address`:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[17] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[18] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

## Development

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

### Database response

The following metric instruments describe database query response.

#### Metric: `db.client.response.returned_rows`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.53.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]`.

Explaining bucket configuration:

1. 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100: These buckets are useful for capturing scenarios where only a small number of items are returned. Such small queries are common in real-time or interactive applications where performance and quick responses are critical.
2. 200, 500, 1000: These values represent typical workloads where moderate amounts of data are returned in each query.
3. 2000, 5000: These boundaries capture scenarios where the query returns large datasets. These larger page sizes can potentially increase memory or CPU usage and may lead to longer query execution times, making it important to track performance in these ranges.
4. 10000: This boundary is included to capture rare, very large response sizes. Such queries can put significant strain on system resources, including memory, CPU, and network bandwidth, and can often lead to performance issues such as high latency or even network drops.

[Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[14] `network.peer.address`:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[15] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[16] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
