## Name

Database spans MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.51.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

The **span name** SHOULD be `{db.query.summary}` if a summary is available.

If no summary is available, the span name SHOULD be `{db.operation.name} {target}`
provided that a (low-cardinality) `db.operation.name` is available (see below for
the exact definition of the [`{target}`](#target-placeholder) placeholder).

If a (low-cardinality) `db.operation.name` is not available, database span names
SHOULD default to the [`{target}`](#target-placeholder).

If neither `{db.operation.name}` nor `{target}` are available, span name SHOULD be `{db.system.name}`.

Semantic conventions for individual database systems MAY specify different span name format.

The <span id="target-placeholder">`{target}`</span> SHOULD describe the entity that the operation is performed against
and SHOULD adhere to one of the following values, provided they are accessible:

- `db.collection.name` SHOULD be used for operations on a specific database collection.
- `db.stored_procedure.name` SHOULD be used for operations on a specific stored procedure.
- `db.namespace` SHOULD be used for operations on a specific database namespace.
- `server.address:server.port` SHOULD be used for other operations not targeting any specific collection(s),
  stored procedure(s), or namespace(s).

If a corresponding `{target}` value is not available for a specific operation, the instrumentation SHOULD omit the `{target}`.
For example, for an operation describing SQL query on an anonymous table like `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM table) t`, span name should be `SELECT`.

**Status:** ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen)

This span describes database client call.

Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
(e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
readily available at the generic query level.

**Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name) section.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
in-memory database calls.
It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when database system being instrumented usually
runs in a different process than its client or when database calls happen over
instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
Semantic conventions for individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
classify as errors.

**Attributes:**

**[1] `db.system.name`:** The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2] `db.collection.name`:** If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.

**[3] `db.collection.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
in non-batch operations.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.

**[4] `db.namespace`:** If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

**[5] `db.operation.name`:** If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call.

**[6] `db.operation.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
in non-batch operations.

If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
system specific term if more applicable.

**[7] `db.response.status_code`:** If the operation failed and status code is available.

**[8] `db.response.status_code`:** The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

**[9] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

**[10] `server.port`:** If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.

**[11] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[12] `db.operation.batch.size`:** Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

**[13] `db.query.summary`:** if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.

**[14] `db.query.summary`:** The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
calls involving complex queries.

Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
[Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
section.

**[15] `db.query.text`:** Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).

**[16] `db.query.text`:** For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

**[17] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** If operation applies to a specific stored procedure.

**[18] `db.stored_procedure.name`:** It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.

**[19] `network.peer.address`:** Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[20] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[21] `db.query.parameter.<key>`:** If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
without attempting to do any case normalization.

`db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

Examples:

- For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
  the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

- For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
  `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`db.collection.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.namespace`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.summary`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.query.text`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`db.system.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

### Notes and well-known identifiers for `db.system.name`

The list above is a non-exhaustive list of well-known identifiers to be specified for `db.system.name`.

If a value defined in this list applies to the DBMS to which the request is sent, this value MUST be used.
If no value defined in this list is suitable, a custom value MUST be provided.
This custom value MUST be the name of the DBMS in lowercase and without a version number to stay consistent with existing identifiers.

It is encouraged to open a PR towards this specification to add missing values to the list, especially when instrumentations for those missing databases are written.
This allows multiple instrumentations for the same database to be aligned and eases analyzing for backends.

The value `other_sql` is intended as a fallback and MUST only be used if the DBMS is known to be SQL-compliant but the concrete product is not known to the instrumentation.
If the concrete DBMS is known to the instrumentation, its specific identifier MUST be used.

Back ends could, for example, use the provided identifier to determine the appropriate SQL dialect for parsing the `db.query.text`.

When additional attributes are added that only apply to a specific DBMS, its identifier SHOULD be used as a namespace in the attribute key as for the attributes in the sections below.

## Sanitization of `db.query.text`

The `db.query.text` SHOULD be collected by default only if there is sanitization that excludes sensitive information.
Sanitization SHOULD replace all literals with a placeholder value.
Such literals include, but are not limited to, String, Numeric, Date and Time,
Boolean, Interval, Binary, and Hexadecimal literals.
The placeholder value SHOULD be `?`, unless it already has a defined meaning in the given database system,
in which case the instrumentation MAY choose a different placeholder.

Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized.
Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query
the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit
to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

[IN-clauses](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax#Operators) MAY be collapsed during sanitization,
e.g. from `IN (?, ?, ?, ?)` to `IN (?)`, as this can help with extremely long IN-clauses,
and can help control cardinality for users who choose to (optionally) add `db.query.text` to their metric attributes.

When performing sanitization, instrumentation MAY truncate the sanitized value
for performance considerations (since sanitizing has a performance cost).

## Generating a summary of the query

The `db.query.summary` attribute can be used to capture a shortened representation
of the query. It SHOULD have low-cardinality and SHOULD NOT contain any dynamic
or sensitive data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `db.query.text` attribute is intended to identify individual queries. Even though
> it is sanitized if captured by default, it could still have high cardinality and
> might reach hundreds of lines.
>
> The `db.query.summary` is intended to provide a less granular grouping key that
> can be used as a span name or a metric attribute in common cases. It SHOULD
> only contain information that has a significant impact on the query, database,
> or application performance.

Instrumentation SHOULD set the query summary if it is readily available through
instrumentation hooks or other sources.

Otherwise:

- When instrumenting higher-level APIs that build queries internally - for example,
  those that create a table or execute a stored procedure - instrumentations SHOULD
  generate a `db.query.summary` from available operation(s) and target(s) using the
  format described in this section.

- When instrumenting APIs that operate at the query level, instrumentations that
  support query parsing SHOULD generate a query summary based on the `db.query.text`.

The summary SHOULD preserve the following parts of query in the order they were provided:

- operations such as SQL SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and other commands
- operation targets such as collections, stored procedures, database names, etc

Instrumentations that support query parsing SHOULD parse the query and extract a
list of operations and targets from the query. It SHOULD set `db.query.summary`
attribute to the value formatted in the following way:

```
{operation1} {target1} {operation2} {target2} {target3} ...
```

Instrumentations SHOULD capture the values of operations and targets as provided
by the application without attempting to do any case normalization. If the operation
and target value is populated on `db.operation.name`, `db.collection.name`,
or other attributes, it SHOULD match the value used in the `db.query.summary`.

Instrumentations that parse the query to set `db.query.summary` SHOULD truncate the
summary to 255 characters (ensuring truncation does not occur within an operation
name or target).

**Examples**:

- Query that consist of a single operation:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM   wuser_table
   WHERE  username = ?
   ```

   the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `SELECT wuser_table`.

- Query that performs multiple operations:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO shipping_details
               (order_id,
               address)
   SELECT order_id,
          address
   FROM   orders
   WHERE  order_id = ?
   ```

   the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `INSERT shipping_details SELECT orders`.

- Query that performs an operation that's applied to multiple collections:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM   songs,
          artists
   WHERE  songs.artist_id == artists.id
   ```

   the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `SELECT songs artists`.

- Query that performs an operation on an anonymous table:

   ```sql
   SELECT order_date
   FROM   (SELECT *
           FROM   orders o
                  JOIN customers c
                    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id)
   ```

   the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `SELECT SELECT orders customers`.

- Query that performs an operation on multiple collections with double-quotes or other punctuation:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM   "song list",
           'artists'
    ```

    the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `SELECT "song list" 'artists'`.

- Stored procedure is executed using a convenience API such as one available in
  [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#prepareCall-java.lang.String-):

  ```java
  connection.prepareCall("{call some_stored_procedure}");
  ```

  the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `call some_stored_procedure`,
  `db.query.text` is not populated. Note that `CALL` is the SQL standard
  keyword to invoke a stored procedure.

- Stored procedure is executed using Microsoft SQL Server driver's convenience API
  [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.commandtype):

    ```csharp
    var command = new SqlCommand();
    command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    command.CommandText = "some_stored_procedure";
    ```

    the corresponding `db.query.summary` is `EXECUTE some_stored_procedure`,
    `db.query.text` is not populated. Note that Microsoft SQL Server does not
    support the SQL Standard `CALL` keyword, but uses instead `EXECUTE`
    to invoke a stored procedure.

Semantic conventions for individual database systems or specialized instrumentations
MAY specify a different `db.query.summary` format as long as produced summary remains
relatively short and its cardinality remains low comparing to the `db.query.text`.

## Context propagation

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

### SQL commenter

Instrumentations MAY propagate context using [SQL commenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/spec/) by injecting comments into SQL queries before execution. SQL commenter-based context propagation SHOULD NOT be enabled by default, but instrumentation MAY allow users to opt into it.

The instrumentation implementation SHOULD **append** the comment to the end of the query. Semantic conventions for individual database systems MAY specify different format, which may include different position, encoding, or schema, depending on the specific database system's requirements or preferences.

The instrumentation SHOULD allow users to pass a propagator to overwrite the global propagator. If no propagator is provided by the user, instrumentation SHOULD use the global propagator.

**Examples:**

- For a query `SELECT * FROM songs` with W3C TraceContext propagator:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM songs /*traceparent='00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01',tracestate='congo%3Dt61rcWkgMzE%2Crojo%3D00f067aa0ba902b7'*/
  ```

  Note that adding high cardinality comments, like `traceparent` and `tracestate`, to queries can impact the performance for some database systems, such as:
  - Prepared statements in MySQL. See [this related issue](https://github.com/google/sqlcommenter/issues/284) for more details.
  - Oracle and SQL Server for both prepared and non-prepared statements.

- For a query `SELECT * FROM songs` with a custom propagator that injects `service.name` into carrier where `service.name` is `shoppingcart`:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM songs /*service.name='shoppingcart'*/
  ```
