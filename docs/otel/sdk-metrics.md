### Metric: `otel.sdk.processor.span.queue.size`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

<!-- semconv metric.otel.sdk.processor.span.queue.size -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `otel.sdk.processor.span.queue.size` | UpDownCounter | `{span}` | The number of spans in the queue of a given instance of an SDK span processor. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** Only applies to span processors which use a queue, e.g. the SDK Batching Span Processor.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [1] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [2] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |

**[1] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[2] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[1]:** Only applies to span processors which use a queue, e.g. the SDK Batching Span Processor.

**Attributes:**

### Metric: `otel.sdk.processor.span.processed`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

<!-- semconv metric.otel.sdk.processor.span.processed -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `otel.sdk.processor.span.processed` | Counter | `{span}` | The number of spans for which the processing has finished, either successful or failed. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** For successful processing, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed processing, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
For the SDK Simple and Batching Span Processor a span is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter, not when the corresponding export call has finished.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue. [1] | `queue_full` |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [2] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [3] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

### Metric: `otel.sdk.exporter.span.exported`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `otel.sdk.exporter.span.exported` | Counter | `{span}` | The number of spans for which the export has finished, either successful or failed. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_spans`), rejected spans MUST count as failed and only non-rejected spans count as success.
If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `rejected`; `timeout`; `500`; `java.net.UnknownHostException` |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [2] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [3] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` when applicable | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [4] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` when applicable | int | Server port number. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |

**[1]:** For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.

**Attributes:**

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [1] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [2] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` when applicable | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[1] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[2] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[3] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[1]:** For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_log_records`), rejected log records MUST count as failed and only non-rejected log records count as success.
If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

## Operation Metrics

### Metric: `otel.sdk.metric_reader.collection.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.42.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
with a single bucket with no boundaries.

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `otel.sdk.metric_reader.collection.duration` | Histogram | `s` | The duration of the collect operation of the metric reader. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** For successful collections, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed collections, `error.type` SHOULD contain the failure cause.
It can happen that metrics collection is successful for some MetricProducers, while others fail. In that case `error.type` SHOULD be set to any of the failure causes.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [2] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/otel.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [3] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1]:** This metric defines successful operations using the full success definitions for [http](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v1.5.0/docs/specification.md#full-success-1)
and [grpc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v1.5.0/docs/specification.md#full-success). Anything else is defined as an unsuccessful operation. For successful
operations, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For unsuccessful export operations, `error.type` MUST contain a relevant failure cause.

Semantic conventions for individual RPC frameworks SHOULD document what `rpc.response.status_code` means in the context of that system and which values are considered to represent errors.

**[5] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
