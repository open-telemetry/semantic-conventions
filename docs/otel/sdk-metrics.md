### Metric: `otel.sdk.processor.span.queue.size`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `otel.sdk.processor.span.queue.size` | UpDownCounter | `{span}` | The number of spans in the queue of a given instance of an SDK span processor [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** Only applies to span processors which use a queue, e.g. the SDK Batching Span Processor.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/otel.md) | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [1] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/otel.md) | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [2] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[2] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[1]:** Only applies to span processors which use a queue, e.g. the SDK Batching Span Processor.

### Metric: `otel.sdk.processor.span.processed.count`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

<!-- semconv metric.otel.sdk.processor.span.processed.count -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `otel.sdk.processor.span.processed.count` | Counter | `{span}` | The number of spans for which the processing has finished, either successful or failed [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** For successful processing, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed processing, `error.type` must contain the failure cause.
For the SDK Simple and Batching Span Processor a span is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter, not when the corresponding export call has finished.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue. [1] | `queue_full` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`otel.component.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/otel.md) | string | A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance. [2] | `otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0`; `custom-name` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`otel.component.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/otel.md) | string | A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry component. [3] | `batching_span_processor`; `com.example.MySpanExporter` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[1] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `otel.component.name`:** Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
instance of the given component type is started.

With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

**[3] `otel.component.type`:** If none of the standardized values apply, implementations SHOULD use the language-defined name of the type.
E.g. for Java the fully qualified classname SHOULD be used in this case.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

## Operation Metrics

### Metric: `otel.sdk.exporter.operation.duration`

This metric is [opt-in][MetricOptIn].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.42.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
with a single bucket with no boundaries.

| `otel.sdk.exporter.operation.duration` | Histogram | `s` | The duration of exporting a batch of telemetry items. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** This metric defines successful operations using the full success definitions for [http](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v1.5.0/docs/specification.md#full-success-1)
and [grpc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v1.5.0/docs/specification.md#full-success). Anything else is defined as an unsuccessful operation. For successful
operations, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For unsuccessful export operations, `error.type` must contain a relevant failure cause.
