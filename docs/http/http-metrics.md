# Semantic Conventions for HTTP Metrics

**Status**: [Experimental, partial feature-freeze][DocumentStatus]

The conventions described in this section are HTTP specific. When HTTP operations occur,
metric events about those operations will be generated and reported to provide insight into the
operations. By adding HTTP attributes to metric events it allows for finely tuned filtering.

**Disclaimer:** These are initial HTTP metric instruments and attributes but more may be added in the future.

## HTTP Server

### Metric: `http.server.request.duration`

**Status**: [Experimental, Feature-freeze][DocumentStatus]

This metric is required.

When this metric is reported alongside an HTTP server span, the metric value SHOULD be the same as the HTTP server span duration.

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.22.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advice)
of `[ 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 ]`.

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.request.duration(metric_table) -->
| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `http.server.request.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Measures the duration of inbound HTTP requests. |
<!-- endsemconv -->

<!-- semconv metric.http.server.request.duration(full) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `http.route` | string | The matched route (path template in the format used by the respective server framework). See note below [1] | `/users/:userID?`; `{controller}/{action}/{id?}` | Conditionally Required: If and only if it's available |
| `error.type` | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `timeout`; `name_resolution_error`; `500` | Conditionally Required: If request has ended with an error. |
| `http.request.method` | string | HTTP request method. [3] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | Required |
| `http.response.status_code` | int | [HTTP response status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6). | `200` | Conditionally Required: If and only if one was received/sent. |
| [`network.protocol.name`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI Application Layer](https://osi-model.com/application-layer/) or non-OSI equivalent. The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase. | `amqp`; `http`; `mqtt` | Recommended |
| [`network.protocol.version`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Version of the application layer protocol used. See note below. [4] | `3.1.1` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Name of the local HTTP server that received the request. [5] | `example.com` | Opt-In |
| [`server.port`](../general/attributes.md) | int | Port of the local HTTP server that received the request. [6] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Opt-In |
| [`url.scheme`](../url/url.md) | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https` | Required |

**[1]:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

**[2]:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type or a component-specific low cardinality error code.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error code.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[3]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[4]:** `network.protocol.version` refers to the version of the protocol used and might be different from the protocol client's version. If the HTTP client used has a version of `0.27.2`, but sends HTTP version `1.1`, this attribute should be set to `1.1`.

**[5]:** Determined by using the first of the following that applies

- The [primary server name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) of the matched virtual host. MUST only
  include host identifier.
- Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
  if it's sent in absolute-form.
- Host identifier of the `Host` header

SHOULD NOT be set if only IP address is available and capturing name would require a reverse DNS lookup.

**[6]:** Determined by using the first of the following that applies

- Port identifier of the [primary server host](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) of the matched virtual host.
- Port identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
  if it's sent in absolute-form.
- Port identifier of the `Host` header

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation does not define a custom value for it. |

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. |
| `DELETE` | DELETE method. |
| `GET` | GET method. |
| `HEAD` | HEAD method. |
| `OPTIONS` | OPTIONS method. |
| `PATCH` | PATCH method. |

| `error.type` | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `name_resolution_error`; `500` | Conditionally Required: If request has ended with an error. |
| `http.request.method` | string | HTTP request method. [2] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | Required |
| `http.response.status_code` | int | [HTTP response status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6). | `200` | Conditionally Required: If and only if one was received/sent. |
| [`network.protocol.name`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI Application Layer](https://osi-model.com/application-layer/) or non-OSI equivalent. The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase. | `amqp`; `http`; `mqtt` | Recommended |
| [`network.protocol.version`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Version of the application layer protocol used. See note below. [3] | `3.1.1` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Host identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [4] | `example.com` | Required |
| [`server.port`](../general/attributes.md) | int | Port identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditionally Required: [6] |
| [`server.socket.address`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Server address of the socket connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. [7] | `10.5.3.2` | Recommended: If different than `server.address`. |

**[1]:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type or a component-specific low cardinality error code.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error code.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[2]:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[3]:** `network.protocol.version` refers to the version of the protocol used and might be different from the protocol client's version. If the HTTP client used has a version of `0.27.2`, but sends HTTP version `1.1`, this attribute should be set to `1.1`.

**[4]:** Determined by using the first of the following that applies

- Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
  if it's sent in absolute-form
- Host identifier of the `Host` header

SHOULD NOT be set if capturing it would require an extra DNS lookup.

**[5]:** When [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource) is absolute URI, `server.port` MUST match URI port identifier, otherwise it MUST match `Host` header port identifier.

**[6]:** If not default (`80` for `http` scheme, `443` for `https`).

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, this SHOULD represent the immediate server peer address.
When observed from the server side, this SHOULD represent the physical server address.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation does not define a custom value for it. |

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. |
| `DELETE` | DELETE method. |
| `GET` | GET method. |
| `HEAD` | HEAD method. |
| `OPTIONS` | OPTIONS method. |
| `PATCH` | PATCH method. |
| `POST` | POST method. |
| `PUT` | PUT method. |
| `TRACE` | TRACE method. |
| `_OTHER` | Any HTTP method that the instrumentation has no prior knowledge of. |
