## CICD Metrics

The conventions described in this section are specific to Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CICD) systems.

**Disclaimer:** These are initial CICD metrics and attributes
but more may be added in the future.

### Metric: `cicd.pipeline.run.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `cicd.pipeline.run.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Duration of a pipeline run grouped by pipeline, state and result. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cicd.pipeline.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The human readable name of the pipeline within a CI/CD system. | `Build and Test`; `Lint`; `Deploy Go Project`; `deploy_to_environment` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cicd.pipeline.run.state`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The pipeline run goes through these states during its lifecycle. | `pending`; `executing`; `finalizing` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cicd.pipeline.result`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The result of a pipeline run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` | `Conditionally Required` [1] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the pipeline run failed. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `cicd.pipeline.result`:** If and only if the pipeline run result has been set during that state.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

---

`cicd.pipeline.result` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| `error` | The pipeline run failed due to an error in the CICD system, eg. due to the worker being killed. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `failure` | The pipeline run did not finish successfully, eg. due to a compile error or a failing test. Such failures are usually detected by non-zero exit codes of the tools executed in the pipeline run. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `skip` | The pipeline run was skipped, eg. due to a precondition not being met. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

| `pending` | The run pending state spans from the event triggering the pipeline run until the execution of the run starts (eg. time spent in a queue, provisioning agents, creating run resources). | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |

**[1]:** There might be errors in a pipeline run that are non fatal (eg. they are suppressed) or in a parallel stage multiple stages could have a fatal error.
This means that this error count might not be the same as the count of metric `cicd.pipeline.run.duration` with run result `failure`.

**[1] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[2] `vcs.ref.head.type`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[3] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

**[4] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.
