## VCS Metrics

The conventions described in this section are specific to Version Control Systems.

**Disclaimer:** These are initial VCS metrics and attributes
but more may be added in the future.

### Metric: `vcs.change.count`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `vcs.change.count` | UpDownCounter | `{change}` | The number of changes (pull requests/merge requests/changelists) in a repository, categorized by their state (e.g. open or merged) | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`vcs.change.state`](/docs/attributes-registry/vcs.md) | string | The state of the change (pull request/merge request/changelist). | `open`; `closed`; `merged` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`vcs.repository.url.full`](/docs/attributes-registry/vcs.md) | string | The [canonical URL](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10347851?hl=en#:~:text=A%20canonical%20URL%20is%20the,Google%20chooses%20one%20as%20canonical.) of the repository providing the complete HTTP(S) address in order to locate and identify the repository through a browser. [1] | `https://github.com/opentelemetry/open-telemetry-collector-contrib`; `https://gitlab.com/my-org/my-project/my-projects-project/repo` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`vcs.repository.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/vcs.md) | string | The human readable name of the repository. It SHOULD NOT include any additional identifier like Group/SubGroup in GitLab or organization in GitHub. [2] | `semantic-conventions`; `my-cool-repo` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

**[2] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.

---

`vcs.change.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `closed` | Closed means the merge request has been closed without merging. This can happen for various reasons, such as the changes being deemed unnecessary, the issue being resolved in another way, or the author deciding to withdraw the request. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `merged` | Merged indicates that the change has been successfully integrated into the target codebase. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `open` | Open means the change is currently active and under review. It hasn't been merged into the target branch yet, and it's still possible to make changes or add comments. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `wip` | WIP (work-in-progress, draft) means the change is still in progress and not yet ready for a full review. It might still undergo significant changes. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[5] `vcs.ref.base.revision`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits. The
revision can be a full [hash value (see

of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
it is identical to the `ref.base.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see

**[1]:** This metric should be reported for each `vcs.line_change.type` value. For example if a ref added 3 lines and removed 2 lines,
instrumentation SHOULD report two measurements: 3 and 2 (both positive numbers).
If number of lines added/removed should be calculated from the start of time, then `vcs.ref.base.name` SHOULD be set to an empty string.

instrumentation SHOULD report two measurements: 3 and 2 (both positive numbers) and `vcs.ref.base.name` is set to `trunk`.
