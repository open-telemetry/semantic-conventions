## CICD Metrics

The conventions described in this section are specific to Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CICD) systems.

**Disclaimer:** These are initial CICD metrics and attributes
but more may be added in the future.

### Guidance on per pipeline run metrics

It might be useful to gather metrics specific to each pipeline run.<br>
Examples of such metrics include:

* host metrics like cpu, memory, disk of the worker on which a pipeline run executes
* container metrics like cpu, memory requests and limits
* runtime metrics of any processes executed as part of the pipeline run like JVM metrics

These metrics could be used to correlate build failures with environment issues like overload or out-of-memory.
They could also be used in pipeline-level aggregations to inform adjustements of allocated worker resources.

When reporting host, container, runtime, and other metrics in CI/CD pipelines, instrumentation authors and application developers SHOULD use applicable [CICD and VCS resource conventions][cicdres] and MAY also associate all or specific metrics with `cicd.pipeline.run` to correlate them with run information.

The [`cicd.pipeline.run`](/docs/resource/cicd.md#cicd-pipeline-run) entity identifies a pipeline run. Associating it with metrics inherently causes high cardinality and may increase costs with some metric storage backends. Thus, `cicd.pipeline.run` entity MUST be opt-in.

### Metric: `cicd.pipeline.run.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `cicd.pipeline.run.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Duration of a pipeline run grouped by pipeline, state and result. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | [`cicd.pipeline`](/docs/registry/entities/cicd.md#cicd-pipeline) |

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`cicd.pipeline.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/cicd.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The human readable name of the pipeline within a CI/CD system. | `Build and Test`; `Lint`; `Deploy Go Project`; `deploy_to_environment` |
| [`cicd.pipeline.run.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/cicd.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The pipeline run goes through these states during its lifecycle. | `pending`; `executing`; `finalizing` |
| [`cicd.pipeline.result`](/docs/registry/attributes/cicd.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` [1] | string | The result of a pipeline run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the pipeline run failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |

**[1] `cicd.pipeline.result`:** If and only if the pipeline run result has been set during that state.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

`cicd.pipeline.result` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| [`vcs.ref.base.revision`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | string | The revision, literally [revised version](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revision), The revision most often refers to a commit object in Git, or a revision number in SVN. [5] | `9d59409acf479dfa0df1aa568182e43e43df8bbe28d60fcf2bc52e30068802cc`; `main`; `123`; `HEAD` |

**[1] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[2] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

**[3] `vcs.ref.base.name`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits.

**[4] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.

**[5] `vcs.ref.base.revision`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits. The
revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
it is identical to the `ref.base.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

**[6] `vcs.ref.head.revision`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),

### Metric: `vcs.ref.revisions_delta`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

<!-- semconv metric.vcs.ref.revisions_delta -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `vcs.ref.revisions_delta` | Gauge | `{revision}` | The number of revisions (commits) a ref (branch) is ahead/behind the branch from the `vcs.ref.base.name` attribute. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | [`vcs.repo`](/docs/registry/entities/vcs.md#vcs-repo) |

**[1]:** This metric should be reported for each `vcs.revision_delta.direction` value. For example if branch `a` is 3 commits behind and 2 commits ahead of `trunk`,
instrumentation SHOULD report two measurements: 3 and 2 (both positive numbers) and `vcs.ref.base.name` is set to `trunk`.

**[1] `vcs.ref.base.name`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits.

**[2] `vcs.ref.base.type`:** `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`
would be the base reference of type branch if you've created a new
reference of type branch from it and created new commits.

**[3] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[4] `vcs.ref.head.type`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[5] `vcs.repository.url.full`:** In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
the `.git` extension.

**[6] `vcs.repository.name`:** Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
the same backends.
