## CICD Spans

The conventions described in this section are specific to Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CICD) systems.

Any resources of the [CICD and VCS resource conventions][cicdres] that apply SHOULD be used.
If resources cannot be used for technical reasons, the resource attributes MAY be set as span attributes.

[cicdres]: /docs/resource/cicd.md (CICD and VCS resource conventions)

### Pipeline run

For all pipeline runs, a span with kind `SERVER` SHOULD be created corresponding to the execution of the pipeline run.

The span name MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.43.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

The span name SHOULD be `{action} {pipeline}` if there is a (low-cardinality) `pipeline` available.
If there is no (low-cardinality) `{pipeline}` available, CI pipeline run span names SHOULD be `{action}`.

The `{action}` SHOULD be one of the following values: `BUILD`, `RUN`, `SYNC`.

The `{pipeline}` SHOULD be the the [`cicd.pipeline.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md).

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cicd.pipeline.result`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The result of a pipeline run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`cicd.pipeline.result` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `cancellation` | The pipeline run was cancelled, eg. by a user manually cancelling the pipeline run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `error` | The pipeline run failed due to an error in the CICD system, eg. due to the worker being killed. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `failure` | The pipeline run did not finish successfully, eg. due to a compile error or a failing test. Such failures are usually detected by non-zero exit codes of the tools executed in the pipeline run. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `skip` | The pipeline run was skipped, eg. due to a precondition not being met. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `success` | The pipeline run finished successfully. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `timeout` | A timeout caused the pipeline run to be interrupted. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Pipeline task run

<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cicd.pipeline.task.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The human readable name of a task within a pipeline. Task here most closely aligns with a [computing process](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in a pipeline. Other terms for tasks include commands, steps, and procedures. | `Run GoLang Linter`; `Go Build`; `go-test`; `deploy_binary` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cicd.pipeline.task.run.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The unique identifier of a task run within a pipeline. | `12097` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cicd.pipeline.task.run.result`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The result of a task run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cicd.pipeline.task.run.url.full`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md) | string | The [URL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) of the pipeline task run, providing the complete address in order to locate and identify the pipeline task run. | `https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/actions/runs/9753949763/job/26920038674?pr=1075` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`cicd.pipeline.task.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md)
* [`cicd.pipeline.task.run.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md)
* [`cicd.pipeline.task.run.url.full`](/docs/attributes-registry/cicd.md)
