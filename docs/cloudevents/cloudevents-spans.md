## Definitions

From the
[CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#overview):

> CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats
> to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

For more information on the concepts, terminology and background of CloudEvents
consult the
[CloudEvents Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md)
document.

## Conventions

CloudEvent-specific instrumentations SHOULD follow the span structure described in
the [Semantic Conventions for Messaging Spans](../messaging/messaging-spans.md).

If CloudEvents are instrumented independently of the above conventions,
instrumentations can rely on the
[CloudEvents Distributed Tracing Extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/extensions/distributed-tracing.md)
as means to propagate the trace context.

## Span attributes

Additionally, instrumentations may record the following CloudEvent-specific
attributes on spans created from the conventions described above.
