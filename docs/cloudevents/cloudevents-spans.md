## Definitions

From the
[CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#overview):

> CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats
> to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

For more information on the concepts, terminology and background of CloudEvents
consult the
[CloudEvents Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md)
document.

## Conventions

CloudEvents can be sent via various transports, such as HTTP or via messaging
systems. Each transport defines its own mechanism of
[trace context propagation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/).

In HTTP for example, context is propagated via headers as specified by the
[W3C TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) specification. Other
transports, such [MQTT](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-mqtt/)
or [AMQP](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-amqp/)
are also defining their own trace context propagation mechanisms.

CloudEvent SDKs and instrumentations SHOULD rely on existing context propagation
mechanisms and follow the existing semantic conventions for each scenario.

When sending CloudEvents via HTTP, the
[Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans](../http/http-spans.md) SHOULD be followed.
When CloudEvents are sent via message brokers, the
[Semantic Conventions for Messaging Spans](../messaging/messaging-spans.md)
SHOULD be followed.

When the transport being used does not have a well stablished
progation mechanism, instrumentations MAY rely on the
[CloudEvents Distributed Tracing Extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/extensions/distributed-tracing.md).
as means to propagate the trace context, while still following either the HTTP
or Messaging span semantic conventions.

The remainder of this section describes additional CloudEvents attributes
that can be recorded on spans in addition to the ones defined by
the aforedmentioned conventions.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudevents.event_id`](/docs/attributes-registry/cloudevents.md) | string | The [event_id](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#id) uniquely identifies the event. | `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`; `0001` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cloudevents.event_source`](/docs/attributes-registry/cloudevents.md) | string | The [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1) identifies the context in which an event happened. | `https://github.com/cloudevents`; `/cloudevents/spec/pull/123`; `my-service` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cloudevents.event_spec_version`](/docs/attributes-registry/cloudevents.md) | string | The [version of the CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#specversion) which the event uses. | `1.0` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cloudevents.event_subject`](/docs/attributes-registry/cloudevents.md) | string | The [subject](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#subject) of the event in the context of the event producer (identified by source). | `mynewfile.jpg` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`cloudevents.event_type`](/docs/attributes-registry/cloudevents.md) | string | The [event_type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#type) contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. | `com.github.pull_request.opened`; `com.example.object.deleted.v2` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
