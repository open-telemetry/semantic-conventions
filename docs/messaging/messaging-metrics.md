## Common metrics

### Metric: `messaging.client.request.duration`

When this metric is reported alongside a messaging span, the metric value SHOULD be the same as the corresponding span duration.

This metric is [required][MetricRequired].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.33.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advice)
of `[ 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 ]`.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`messaging.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | The system-specific name of the messaging operation. | `send`; `receive`; `ack` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.system`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | The messaging system as identified by the client instrumentation. [1] | `activemq`; `aws_sqs`; `eventgrid` | `Required` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [2] | `amqp:decode-error`; `KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR`; `channel-error` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the messaging operation has failed. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`messaging.destination.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | The message destination name [3] | `MyQueue`; `MyTopic` | `Conditionally Required` [4] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.destination.template`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | Low cardinality representation of the messaging destination name [5] | `/customers/{customerId}` | `Conditionally Required` if available. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | A string identifying the type of the messaging operation. [6] | `publish`; `create`; `receive` | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [7] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Conditionally Required` If available. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`messaging.destination.partition.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | The identifier of the partition messages are sent to or received from, unique within the `messaging.destination.name`. | `1` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [8] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1]:** The actual messaging system may differ from the one known by the client. For example, when using Kafka client libraries to communicate with Azure Event Hubs, the `messaging.system` is set to `kafka` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2]:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

* Use a domain-specific attribute
* Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[4]:** if and only if `messaging.destination.name` is known to have low cardinality. Otherwise, `messaging.destination.template` MAY be populated.

**[5]:** Destination names could be constructed from templates. An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id. Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for grouping and aggregation.

**[6]:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[7]:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[8]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |


`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |

| `deliver` | Deprecated. Use `process` instead. | ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/-deprecated-red)<br>Replaced by `process`. |
| `process` | One or more messages are processed by a consumer. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `publish` | One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary. If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |


`messaging.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

**[1]:** The actual messaging system may differ from the one known by the client. For example, when using Kafka client libraries to communicate with Azure Event Hubs, the `messaging.system` is set to `kafka` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

**[2]:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

* Use a domain-specific attribute
* Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[4]:** if and only if `messaging.destination.name` is known to have low cardinality. Otherwise, `messaging.destination.template` MAY be populated.

**[5]:** Destination names could be constructed from templates. An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id. Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for grouping and aggregation.

**[6]:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[7]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
