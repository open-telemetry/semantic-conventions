# Semantic Conventions for RabbitMQ

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md)
that describe common messaging operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"rabbitmq"`.

## RabbitMQ attributes

In RabbitMQ, the destination is defined by an *exchange* and a *routing key*.
`messaging.destination.name` MUST be set to the name of the exchange. This will be an empty string if the default exchange is used.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`messaging.rabbitmq.destination.routing_key`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | RabbitMQ message routing key. | `myKey` | `Conditionally Required`  [1] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.rabbitmq.message.delivery_tag`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | int | RabbitMQ message delivery tag | `123` | `Conditionally Required`  [2] | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Peer address of the messaging intermediary node where the operation was performed. [3] | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/network.md) | int | Peer port of the messaging intermediary node where the operation was performed. | `65123` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |



**[1]:** If not empty.
**[2]:** When available.
**[3]:** If an operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
 
 `messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `publish` | One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary. If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch publishing scenarios. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `process` | One or more messages are delivered to or processed by a consumer. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
 
 `messaging.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `activemq` | Apache ActiveMQ | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `aws_sqs` | Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `eventgrid` | Azure Event Grid | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `eventhubs` | Azure Event Hubs | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

| `gcp_pubsub` | Google Cloud Pub/Sub | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `jms` | Java Message Service | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `kafka` | Apache Kafka | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
