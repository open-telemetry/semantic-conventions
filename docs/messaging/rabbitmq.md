# Semantic Conventions for RabbitMQ

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md)
that describe common messaging operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"rabbitmq"`.

## RabbitMQ attributes

In RabbitMQ, the destination is defined by an *exchange* and a *routing key*.
`messaging.destination.name` MUST be set to the name of the exchange. This will be an empty string if the default exchange is used.

<!-- semconv messaging.rabbitmq(full,tag=tech-specific) -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`messaging.rabbitmq.destination.routing_key`](../attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | RabbitMQ message routing key. | `myKey` | Conditionally Required: If not empty. |
| [`messaging.rabbitmq.message.delivery_tag`](../attributes-registry/messaging.md) | int | RabbitMQ message delivery tag | `123` | Conditionally Required: When available. |
| [`network.peer.address`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Peer address of the messaging intermediary node where the operation was performed. [1] | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Recommended |
| [`network.peer.port`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | int | Peer port of the messaging intermediary node where the operation was performed. | `65123` | Recommended |

**[1]:** If an operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.
