# Semantic Conventions for Google Cloud Pub/Sub

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md).

> [!Warning]
>
> Existing messaging instrumentations that are using
> [v1.24.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md)
> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the messaging conventions that they emit by default
>   until the messaging semantic conventions are marked stable.
>   Conventions include, but are not limited to, attributes,
>   metric and span names, span kind and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in the existing major version which is a comma-separated list of values.
>   The list of values includes:
>   * `messaging` - emit the new, stable messaging conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental messaging conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `messaging/dup` - emit both the old and the stable messaging conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental messaging conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `messaging/dup` has higher precedence than `messaging` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.
> * SHOULD emit the new, stable values for span name, span kind and similar "single"
> valued concepts when `messaging/dup` is present in the list.

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"gcp_pubsub"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [8] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Conditionally Required` If available. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`messaging.destination.subscription.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | Google Pub/Sub [subscription name](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscription-overview). | `subscription-a` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.gcp_pubsub.message.ack_deadline`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | int | The ack deadline in seconds set for the modify ack deadline request. | `10` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.gcp_pubsub.message.ack_id`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | The ack id for a given message. | `ack_id` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.gcp_pubsub.message.delivery_attempt`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | int | The delivery attempt for a given message. | `2` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`messaging.message.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | A value used by the messaging system as an identifier for the message, represented as a string. | `452a7c7c7c7048c2f887f61572b18fc2` | `Recommended` If span describes operation on a single message. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Server port number. [9] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `messaging.operation.name`:** The `messaging.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values in the context of Google Pub/Sub.
If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

- `ack` and `nack` for settlement operations
- `send` for publishing operations
- `modack` for extending the lease for a single message or batch of messages
- `subscribe` for operations that represent the time from after the message was received to when the message is acknowledged, negatively acknowledged, or expired.
- `create` and `receive` for [common messaging operations](/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md#operation-types)

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3] `messaging.batch.message_count`:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[4] `messaging.batch.message_count`:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.

**[5] `messaging.destination.name`:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[6] `messaging.destination.name`:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[7] `messaging.operation.type`:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[8] `server.address`:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[9] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`messaging.destination.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.destination.subscription.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch sending scenarios. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `process` | One or more messages are processed by a consumer. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `send` | One or more messages are provided for sending to an intermediary. If a single message is sent, the context of the "Send" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
