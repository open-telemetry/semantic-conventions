# Semantic Conventions for Kafka

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

<!-- tocstop -->

The Semantic Conventions for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md)
that describe common messaging operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"kafka"`.

## Span attributes

For Apache Kafka, the following additional attributes are defined:

| [`messaging.kafka.message.key`](/docs/attributes-registry/messaging.md) | string | Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.

**[1]:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[2]:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

* Use a domain-specific attribute
* Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3]:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[4]:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.

**[5]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[6]:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[7]:** If value is `true`. When missing, the value is assumed to be `false`.

**[8]:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[9]:** If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute. If the key has no unambiguous, canonical string form, don't include its value.

**[10]:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed body size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
body size should be used.

**[11]:** If the operation is not sufficiently described by `messaging.operation.type`.

**[12]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |


`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch publishing scenarios. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `process` | One or more messages are delivered to or processed by a consumer. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `publish` | One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary. If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

For Apache Kafka producers, [`peer.service`](/docs/general/attributes.md#general-remote-service-attributes) SHOULD be set to the name of the broker or service the message will be sent to.
The `service.name` of a Consumer's Resource SHOULD match the `peer.service` of the Producer, when the message is directly passed to another service.
If an intermediary broker is present, `service.name` and `peer.service` will not be the same.

`messaging.client.id` SHOULD be set to the client name of a consumer or producer, which is unique for each individual instance.

## Examples

### Apache Kafka with Quarkus or Spring Boot Example

Given is a process P, that publishes a message to a topic T1 on Apache Kafka.
One process, CA, receives the message and publishes a new message to a topic T2 that is then received and processed by CB.

Frameworks such as Quarkus and Spring Boot separate processing of a received message from producing subsequent messages out.
For this reason, receiving (Span Rcv1) is the parent of both processing (Span Proc1) and producing a new message (Span Prod2).
The span representing message receiving (Span Rcv1) should not set `messaging.operation.type` to `receive`,
as it does not only receive the message but also converts the input message to something suitable for the processing operation to consume and creates the output message from the result of processing.

```
Process P:  | Span Prod1 |
--
Process CA:              | Span Rcv1 |
                                | Span Proc1 |
                                  | Span Prod2 |
--
Process CB:                           | Span Rcv2 |
```

| Field or Attribute | Span Prod1 | Span Rcv1 | Span Proc1 | Span Prod2 | Span Rcv2 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Span name | `"T1 publish"` | `"T1 receive"` | `"T1 process"` | `"T2 publish"` | `"T2 receive`" |
| Parent |  | Span Prod1 | Span Rcv1 | Span Rcv1 | Span Prod2 |
| Links |  |  | |  |  |
| SpanKind | `PRODUCER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` | `PRODUCER` | `CONSUMER` |

| `peer.service` | `"myKafka"` |  |  | `"myKafka"` |  |

| `messaging.kafka.consumer.group` |  | `"my-group"` | `"my-group"` |  | `"another-group"` |
