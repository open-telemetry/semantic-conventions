# Semantic conventions for AWS SNS

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for AWS SNS extend the general
[AWS SDK Semantic Conventions](/docs/cloud-providers/aws-sdk.md)
that describe common AWS SDK attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`messaging.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The system-specific name of the messaging operation. | `ack`; `nack`; `send` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the messaging operation has failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `amqp:decode-error`; `KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR`; `channel-error` |
| [`messaging.destination.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` [2] | string | The message destination name [3] | `MyQueue`; `MyTopic` |
| [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | string | A string identifying the type of the messaging operation. [4] | `create`; `send`; `receive` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [5] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`aws.request_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/aws.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The AWS request ID as returned in the response headers `x-amzn-requestid`, `x-amzn-request-id` or `x-amz-request-id`. | `79b9da39-b7ae-508a-a6bc-864b2829c622`; `C9ER4AJX75574TDJ` |
| [`aws.sns.topic.arn`](/docs/registry/attributes/aws.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The ARN of the AWS SNS Topic. An Amazon SNS [topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html) is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel. | `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:mystack-mytopic-NZJ5JSMVGFIE` |
| [`messaging.message.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` If span describes operation on a single message. | string | A value used by the messaging system as an identifier for the message, represented as a string. | `452a7c7c7c7048c2f887f61572b18fc2` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | int | Server port number. [6] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `messaging.destination.name`:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[3] `messaging.destination.name`:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[4] `messaging.operation.type`:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[5] `server.address`:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[6] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`messaging.destination.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch sending scenarios. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `process` | One or more messages are processed by a consumer. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `send` | One or more messages are provided for sending to an intermediary. If a single message is sent, the context of the "Send" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
