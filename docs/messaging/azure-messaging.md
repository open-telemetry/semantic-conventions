# Semantic Conventions for Azure Messaging systems

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) and [Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md) that describe common messaging operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions described on this page.

## Azure Service Bus

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"servicebus"`.

### Span attributes

The following additional attributes are defined:
<!-- semconv messaging.servicebus -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->

**[1]:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

* Use a domain-specific attribute
* Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2]:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[3]:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.

**[4]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[5]:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[6]:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[7]:** If delivery count is available and is bigger than 0.

**[8]:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[9]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.



`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |


`messaging.operation.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | A message is created. "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch publishing scenarios. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `deliver` | Deprecated. Use `process` instead. | ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/-deprecated-red)<br>Replaced by `process`. |
| `process` | One or more messages are processed by a consumer. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `publish` | One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary. If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `receive` | One or more messages are requested by a consumer. This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |


`messaging.servicebus.disposition_status` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `abandon` | Message is abandoned | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `complete` | Message is completed | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `dead_letter` | Message is sent to dead letter queue | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `defer` | Message is deferred | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
