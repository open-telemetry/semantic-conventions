# Semantic conventions for Azure messaging systems

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) and [Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Existing messaging instrumentations that are using
> [v1.24.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md)
> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the messaging conventions that they emit by default
>   until the messaging semantic conventions are marked stable.
>   Conventions include, but are not limited to, attributes,
>   metric and span names, span kind and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   in the existing major version as a comma-separated list of category-specific values
>   (e.g., http, databases, messaging). The list of values includes:
>   * `messaging` - emit the new, stable messaging conventions,
>     and stop emitting the old experimental messaging conventions
>     that the instrumentation emitted previously.
>   * `messaging/dup` - emit both the old and the stable messaging conventions,
>     allowing for a seamless transition.
>   * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
>     emitting whatever version of the old experimental messaging conventions
>     the instrumentation was emitting previously.
>   * Note: `messaging/dup` has higher precedence than `messaging` in case both values are present
> * SHOULD maintain (security patching at a minimum) the existing major version
>   for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
> * SHOULD drop the environment variable in the next major version.
> * SHOULD emit the new, stable values for span name, span kind and similar "single"
> valued concepts when `messaging/dup` is present in the list.

## Azure Service Bus

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"servicebus"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

### Span attributes

The following additional attributes are defined:

<!-- semconv messaging.servicebus -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If applicable. | string | A string identifying the type of the messaging operation. [7] | `create`; `send`; `receive` |
| [`messaging.servicebus.disposition_status`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` if and only if `messaging.operation` is `settle`. | string | Describes the [settlement type](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#peeklock). | `complete`; `abandon`; `dead_letter` |
| [`messaging.servicebus.message.delivery_count`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` [8] | int | Number of deliveries that have been attempted for this message. | `2` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [9] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`messaging.message.conversation_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Message [correlation Id](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messages-payloads#message-routing-and-correlation) property. | `MyConversationId` |
| [`messaging.message.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` If span describes operation on a single message. | string | A value used by the messaging system as an identifier for the message, represented as a string. | `452a7c7c7c7048c2f887f61572b18fc2` |
| [`messaging.servicebus.message.enqueued_time`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | int | The UTC epoch seconds at which the message has been accepted and stored in the entity. | `1701393730` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | int | Server port number. [10] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `messaging.operation.name`:** The operation name SHOULD match one of the following values:

- sender operations: `send`, `schedule`, `cancel_scheduled`
- transaction operations: `create_transaction`, `commit_transaction`, `rollback_transaction`
- receiver operation: `receive`, `peek`, `receive_deferred`, `renew_message_lock`
- settlement operations: `abandon`, `complete`, `defer`, `dead_letter`, `delete`
- session operations: `accept_session`, `get_session_state`, `set_session_state`, `renew_session_lock`

If none of the above operation names apply, the attribute SHOULD be set
to the name of the client method in snake_case.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3] `messaging.batch.message_count`:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.

**[4] `messaging.batch.message_count`:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[5] `messaging.destination.name`:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[6] `messaging.destination.name`:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[7] `messaging.operation.type`:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[8] `messaging.servicebus.message.delivery_count`:** If delivery count is available and is bigger than 0.

**[9] `server.address`:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[10] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`messaging.destination.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.destination.subscription.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`messaging.operation.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/messaging.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

| `settle` | One or more messages are settled. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
