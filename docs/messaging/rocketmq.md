# Semantic Conventions for RocketMQ

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/) extend and override the [Messaging Semantic Conventions](README.md)
that describe common messaging operations attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

`messaging.system` MUST be set to `"rocketmq"`.

## Apache RocketMQ attributes

Specific attributes for Apache RocketMQ are defined below.

**[1]:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.
**[2]:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

* Use a domain-specific attribute
* Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[3]:** If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
**[4]:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[5]:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.
**[6]:** If value is `true`. When missing, the value is assumed to be `false`.
**[7]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[8]:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.
**[9]:** Destination names could be constructed from templates. An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id. Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for grouping and aggregation.

**[10]:** If available. Instrumentations MUST NOT use `messaging.destination.name` as template unless low-cardinality of destination name is guaranteed.

**[11]:** If value is `true`. When missing, the value is assumed to be `false`.
**[12]:** If the message type is delay and delivery timestamp is not specified.
**[13]:** If the message type is delay and delay time level is not specified.
**[14]:** If the message type is FIFO.
**[15]:** Server domain name of the broker if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.

**[16]:** If available.
**[17]:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed body size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
body size should be used.

**[18]:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
size should be used.

**[19]:** Semantic conventions for individual messaging systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable.
Network peer address and port are important when the application interacts with individual intermediary nodes directly,
If a messaging operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

**[20]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
