## Definitions

### Message

Although messaging systems are not as standardized as, e.g., HTTP, it is assumed that the following definitions are applicable to most of them that have similar concepts at all (names borrowed mostly from JMS):

A *message* is an envelope with a potentially empty body.
This envelope may offer the possibility to convey additional metadata, often in key/value form.

A message is sent by a message *producer* to:

* Physically: some message *broker* (which can be e.g., a single server, or a cluster, or a local process reached via IPC). The broker handles the actual delivery, re-delivery, persistence, etc. In some messaging systems the broker may be identical or co-located with (some) message consumers.
With Apache Kafka, the physical broker a message is written to depends on the number of partitions, and which broker is the *leader* of the partition the record is written to.
* Logically: some particular message *destination*.

Messages can be delivered to 0, 1, or multiple consumers depending on the dispatching semantic of the protocol.

### Producer

The "producer" is a specific instance, process or device that creates and
publishes a message. "Publishing" is the process of sending a message or batch
of messages to the intermediary or consumer.

### Consumer

A "consumer" receives the message and acts upon it. It uses the context and
data to execute some logic, which might lead to the occurrence of new events.

The consumer receives, processes, and settles a message. "Receiving" is the
process of obtaining a message from the intermediary, "processing" is the
process of acting on the information a message contains, "settling" is the
process of notifying an intermediary that a message was processed successfully.

### Intermediary

An "intermediary" receives a message to forward it to the next receiver, which
might be another intermediary or a consumer.

### Destinations

A destination represents the entity within a messaging system where
messages are published to and consumed from.

A destination is usually uniquely identified by its name within
the messaging system instance.
Examples of a destination name would be an URL or a simple one-word identifier.

In some use cases, messages are routed within one or multiple brokers. In such
cases, the destination the message was originally published to is different
from the destination it is being consumed from. When information about the
destination where the message was originally published to is available, consumers
can record them under the `destination_publish` namespace.

Typical examples of destinations include Kafka topics, RabbitMQ queues and topics.

### Message consumption

The consumption of a message can happen in multiple steps.
First, the lower-level receiving of a message at a consumer, and then the logical processing of the message.
Often, the waiting for a message is not particularly interesting and hidden away in a framework that only invokes some handler function to process a message once one is received
(in the same way that the listening on a TCP port for an incoming HTTP message is not particularly interesting).

### Conversations

In some messaging systems, a message can receive one or more reply messages that answers a particular other message that was sent earlier. All messages that are grouped together by such a reply-relationship are called a *conversation*.
The grouping usually happens through some sort of "In-Reply-To:" meta information or an explicit *conversation ID* (sometimes called *correlation ID*).
Sometimes a conversation can span multiple message destinations (e.g. initiated via a topic, continued on a temporary one-to-one queue).

### Temporary and anonymous destinations

Some messaging systems support the concept of *temporary destination* (often only temporary queues) that are established just for a particular set of communication partners (often one to one) or conversation.
Often such destinations are also unnamed (anonymous) or have an auto-generated name.

## Conventions

Given these definitions, the remainder of this section describes the semantic conventions for Spans describing interactions with messaging systems.

### Context propagation

A message may traverse many different components and layers in one or more intermediaries
when it is propagated from the producer to the consumer(s). To be able to correlate
consumer traces with producer traces using the existing context propagation mechanisms,
all components must propagate context down the chain.

Messaging systems themselves may trace messages as the messages travels from
producers to consumers. Such tracing would cover the transport layer but would
not help in correlating producers with consumers. To be able to directly
correlate producers with consumers, another context that is propagated with
the message is required.

A message *creation context* allows correlating producers with consumers
of a message and model the dependencies between them,
regardless of the underlying messaging transport mechanism and its instrumentation.

The message creation context is created by the producer and should be propagated
to the consumer(s). Consumer traces cannot be directly correlated with producer
traces if the message creation context is not attached and propagated with the message.

A producer SHOULD attach a message creation context to each message.
If possible, the message creation context SHOULD be attached
in such a way that it cannot be changed by intermediaries.

> This document does not specify the exact mechanisms on how the creation context
> is attached/extracted to/from messages. Future versions of these conventions
> will give clear recommendations, following industry standards including, but not limited to
> [Trace Context: AMQP protocol](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-amqp/) and
> [Trace Context: MQTT protocol](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-mqtt/)
> once those standards reach a stable state.

### Span name

The span name SHOULD be set to the message destination name and the operation being performed in the following format:

```
<destination name> <operation name>
```

The destination name SHOULD only be used for the span name if it is known to be of low cardinality (cf. [general span name guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.22.0/specification/trace/api.md#span)).
This can be assumed if it is statically derived from application code or configuration.
Wherever possible, the real destination names after resolving logical or aliased names SHOULD be used.
If the destination name is dynamic, such as a [conversation ID](#conversations) or a value obtained from a `Reply-To` header, it SHOULD NOT be used for the span name.
In these cases, an artificial destination name that best expresses the destination, or a generic, static fallback like `"(anonymous)"` for [anonymous destinations](#temporary-and-anonymous-destinations) SHOULD be used instead.

The values allowed for `<operation name>` are defined in the section [Operation names](#operation-names) below.
If the format above is used, the operation name MUST match the `messaging.operation` attribute defined for message consumer spans below.

Examples:

* `shop.orders publish`
* `shop.orders receive`
* `shop.orders process`
* `print_jobs publish`
* `topic with spaces process`
* `AuthenticationRequest-Conversations process`
* `(anonymous) publish` (`(anonymous)` being a stable identifier for an unnamed destination)

### Span kind

A producer of a message should set the span kind to `PRODUCER` unless it synchronously waits for a response: then it should use `CLIENT`.
The processor of the message should set the kind to `CONSUMER`, unless it always sends back a reply that is directed to the producer of the message
(as opposed to e.g., a queue on which the producer happens to listen): then it should use `SERVER`.

### Operation names

The following operations related to messages are defined for these semantic conventions:

| Operation name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `publish`      | A message is sent to a destination by a message producer/client.       |
| `receive`      | A message is received from a destination by a message consumer/server. |
| `process`      | A message that was previously received from a destination is processed by a message consumer/server. |

| [`network.protocol.version`](../general/attributes.md) | string | Version of the application layer protocol used. See note below. [16] | `3.1.1` | Recommended |
| [`network.transport`](../general/attributes.md) | string | [OSI Transport Layer](https://osi-model.com/transport-layer/) or [Inter-process Communication method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase. | `tcp`; `udp` | Recommended |

**[1]:** If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.

**[2]:** Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

**[3]:** If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.

**[4]:** If value is `true`. When missing, the value is assumed to be `false`.

**[5]:** Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
the broker does not have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

**[6]:** If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.

**[7]:** Destination names could be constructed from templates. An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id. Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality, the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively used for grouping and aggregation.

**[8]:** If available. Instrumentations MUST NOT use `messaging.destination.name` as template unless low-cardinality of destination name is guaranteed.

**[9]:** If value is `true`. When missing, the value is assumed to be `false`.

**[10]:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed body size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
body size should be used.

**[11]:** Only if span represents operation on a single message.

**[12]:** Only if span represents operation on a single message.

**[13]:** This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
size should be used.

**[14]:** Only if span represents operation on a single message.

**[15]:** Only for spans that represent an operation on a single message.

**[16]:** `network.protocol.version` refers to the version of the protocol used and might be different from the protocol client's version. If the HTTP client used has a version of `0.27.2`, but sends HTTP version `1.1`, this attribute should be set to `1.1`.

**[17]:** This should be the IP/hostname of the broker (or other network-level peer) this specific message is sent to/received from.

**[18]:** When observed from the client side, this SHOULD represent the immediate server peer address.
When observed from the server side, this SHOULD represent the physical server address.

**[19]:** Typically observed from the client side, and represents a proxy or other intermediary domain name.

**[20]:** If different than `server.address` and if `server.socket.address` is set.

**[21]:** When observed from the client side, this SHOULD represent the immediate server peer port.
When observed from the server side, this SHOULD represent the physical server port.

`messaging.operation` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `publish` | publish |
| `receive` | receive |
| `process` | process |
<!-- endsemconv -->

Additionally `server.port` from the [network attributes][] is recommended.
Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to add the [`network.transport`][] attribute and follow its guidelines, especially for in-process queueing systems (like [Hangfire][], for example).
These attributes should be set to the broker to which the message is sent/from which it is received.

### Attribute namespaces

- `messaging.message`: Contains attributes that describe individual messages
- `messaging.destination`: Contains attributes that describe the logical entity messages are published to. See [Destinations](#destinations) for more details
- `messaging.destination_publish`: Contains attributes that describe the logical entity messages were originally published to. See [Destinations](#destinations) for more details
- `messaging.batch`: Contains attributes that describe batch operations
- `messaging.consumer`: Contains attributes that describe application instance that consumes a message. See [consumer](#consumer) for more details

Communication with broker is described with general [network attributes].

Messaging system-specific attributes MUST be defined in the corresponding `messaging.{system}` namespace
as described in [Attributes specific to certain messaging systems](#attributes-specific-to-certain-messaging-systems).

[network attributes]: /docs/general/attributes.md#server-and-client-attributes
[`network.transport`]: /docs/general/attributes.md#network-attributes
[Hangfire]: https://www.hangfire.io/

### Consumer attributes

The following additional attributes describe message consumer operations.

Since messages could be routed by brokers, the destination messages are published
to may not match with the destination they are consumed from.

If information about the original destination is available on the consumer,
consumer instrumentations SHOULD populate the attributes
under the namespace `messaging.destination_publish.*`

<!-- semconv messaging.destination_publish -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `messaging.destination_publish.name` | string | The name of the original destination the message was published to [1] | `MyQueue`; `MyTopic` | Recommended |
| `messaging.destination_publish.anonymous` | boolean | A boolean that is true if the publish message destination is anonymous (could be unnamed or have auto-generated name). |  | Recommended |

**[1]:** The name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic, or other entity within the broker. If
the broker does not have such notion, the original destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
<!-- endsemconv -->

The *receive* span is used to track the time used for receiving the message(s), whereas the *process* span(s) track the time for processing the message(s).
Note that one or multiple Spans with `messaging.operation` = `process` may often be the children of a Span with `messaging.operation` = `receive`.
The distinction between receiving and processing of messages is not always of particular interest or sometimes hidden away in a framework (see the [Message consumption](#message-consumption) section above) and therefore the attribute can be left out.
For batch receiving and processing (see the [Batch receiving](#batch-receiving) and [Batch processing](#batch-processing) examples below) in particular, the attribute SHOULD be set.
Even though in that case one might think that the processing span's kind should be `INTERNAL`, that kind MUST NOT be used.
Instead span kind should be set to either `CONSUMER` or `SERVER` according to the rules defined above.

### Per-message attributes

All messaging operations (`publish`, `receive`, `process`, or others not covered by this specification) can describe both single and/or batch of messages.
Attributes in the `messaging.message` or `messaging.{system}.message` namespace describe individual messages. For single-message operations they SHOULD be set on corresponding span.

For batch operations, per-message attributes are usually different and cannot be set on the corresponding span. In such cases the attributes MAY be set on links. See [Batch Receiving](#batch-receiving) and [Batch Processing](#batch-processing) for more information on correlation using links.

Some messaging systems (e.g., Kafka, Azure EventGrid) allow publishing a single batch of messages to different topics. In such cases, the attributes in `messaging.destination` MAY be
set on links. Instrumentations MAY set destination attributes on the span if all messages in the batch share the same destination.

### Attributes specific to certain messaging systems

All attributes that are specific for a messaging system SHOULD be populated in `messaging.{system}` namespace. Attributes that describe a message, a destination, a consumer, or a batch of messages SHOULD be populated under the corresponding namespace:

* `messaging.{system}.message.*`: Describes attributes for individual messages
* `messaging.{system}.destination.*`: Describes the destination a message (or a batch) are published to and received from respectively. The combination of attributes in these namespaces should uniquely identify the entity and include properties significant for this messaging system. For example, Kafka instrumentations should include partition identifier.
* `messaging.{system}.consumer.*`: Describes message consumer properties
* `messaging.{system}.batch.*`: Describes message batch properties

## Examples

### Topic with multiple consumers

Given is a process P, that publishes a message to a topic T on messaging system MS, and two processes CA and CB, which both receive the message and process it.

```
Process P:  | Span Prod1 |
--
Process CA:              | Span CA1 |
--
Process CB:                 | Span CB1 |
```

| Field or Attribute | Span Prod1 | Span CA1 | Span CB1 |
|-|-|-|-|
| Span name | `"T publish"` | `"T process"` | `"T process"` |
| Parent |  | Span Prod1 | Span Prod1 |
| Links |  |  |  |
| SpanKind | `PRODUCER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` |
| Status | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` |
| `server.address` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` |
| `server.port` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` |
| `messaging.system` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` |
| `messaging.destination.name` | `"T"` | `"T"` | `"T"` |
| `messaging.operation` |  | `"process"` | `"process"` |
| `messaging.message.id` | `"a1"` | `"a1"`| `"a1"` |

### Batch receiving

Given is a process P, that publishes two messages to a queue Q on messaging system MS, and a process C, which receives both of them in one batch (Span Recv1) and processes each message separately (Spans Proc1 and Proc2).

Since a span can only have one parent and the propagated trace and span IDs are not known when the receiving span is started, the receiving span will have no parent and the processing spans are correlated with the producing spans using links.

```
Process P: | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 |
--
Process C:                      | Span Recv1 |
                                        | Span Proc1 |
                                               | Span Proc2 |
```

| Field or Attribute | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 | Span Recv1 | Span Proc1 | Span Proc2 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Span name | `"Q publish"` | `"Q publish"` | `"Q receive"` | `"Q process"` | `"Q process"` |
| Parent |  |  |  | Span Recv1 | Span Recv1 |
| Links |  |  |  | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 |
| SpanKind | `PRODUCER` | `PRODUCER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` |
| Status | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` |
| `server.address` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` |
| `server.port` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` |
| `messaging.system` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` |
| `messaging.destination.name` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` |
| `messaging.operation` |  |  | `"receive"` | `"process"` | `"process"` |
| `messaging.message.id` | `"a1"` | `"a2"` | | `"a1"` | `"a2"` |
| `messaging.batch.message_count` |  |  | 2 |  |  |

### Batch processing

Given is a process P, that publishes two messages to a queue Q on messaging system MS, and a process C, which receives them separately in two different operations (Span Recv1 and Recv2) and processes both messages in one batch (Span Proc1).

Since each span can only have one parent, C3 should not choose a random parent out of C1 and C2, but rather rely on the implicitly selected parent as defined by the [tracing API spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.22.0/specification/trace/api.md).
Depending on the implementation, the producing spans might still be available in the meta data of the messages and should be added to C3 as links.
The client library or application could also add the receiver span's SpanContext to the data structure it returns for each message. In this case, C3 could also add links to the receiver spans C1 and C2.

The status of the batch processing span is selected by the application. Depending on the semantics of the operation. A span status `Ok` could, for example, be set only if all messages or if just at least one were properly processed.

```
Process P: | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 |
--
Process C:                              | Span Recv1 | Span Recv2 |
                                                                   | Span Proc1 |
```

| Field or Attribute | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 | Span Recv1 | Span Recv2 | Span Proc1 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Span name | `"Q publish"` | `"Q publish"` | `"Q receive"` | `"Q receive"` | `"Q process"` |
| Parent |  |  | Span Prod1 | Span Prod2 |  |
| Links |  |  |  |  | [Span Prod1, Span Prod2 ] |
| Link attributes |  |  |  |  | Span Prod1: `messaging.message.id`: `"a1"`  |
|                 |  |  |  |  | Span Prod2: `messaging.message.id`: `"a2"`  |
| SpanKind | `PRODUCER` | `PRODUCER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` | `CONSUMER` |
| Status | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` | `Ok` |
| `server.address` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` | `"ms"` |
| `server.port` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` | `1234` |
| `messaging.system` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` | `"rabbitmq"` |
| `messaging.destination.name` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` | `"Q"` |
| `messaging.operation` |  |  | `"receive"` | `"receive"` | `"process"` |
| `messaging.message.id` | `"a1"` | `"a2"` | `"a1"` | `"a2"` | |
| `messaging.batch.message_count` | | | 1 | 1 | 2 |
