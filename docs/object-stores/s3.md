# Semantic Conventions for AWS S3

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for AWS S3 extend the general
[AWS SDK Semantic Conventions](/docs/cloud-providers/aws-sdk.md)
that describe common AWS SDK attributes in addition to the Semantic Conventions
described on this page.

<!-- semconv aws.s3 -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`aws.s3.bucket`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | string | The S3 bucket name the request refers to. Corresponds to the `--bucket` parameter of the [S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html) operations. [1] | `some-bucket-name` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`aws.s3.copy_source`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | string | The source object (in the form `bucket`/`key`) for the copy operation. [2] | `someFile.yml` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`aws.s3.delete`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | string | The delete request container that specifies the objects to be deleted. [3] | `Objects=[{Key=string,VersionId=string},{Key=string,VersionId=string}],Quiet=boolean` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`aws.s3.key`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | string | The S3 object key the request refers to. Corresponds to the `--key` parameter of the [S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html) operations. [4] | `someFile.yml` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`aws.s3.part_number`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | int | The part number of the part being uploaded in a multipart-upload operation. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. [5] | `3456` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| [`aws.s3.upload_id`](../attributes-registry/aws.md) | string | Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload. [6] | `dfRtDYWFbkRONycy.Yxwh66Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ` | `Recommended` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** The `bucket` attribute is applicable to all S3 operations that reference a bucket, i.e. that require the bucket name as a mandatory parameter.
This applies to almost all S3 operations except `list-buckets`.

**[2]:** The `copy_source` attribute applies to S3 copy operations and corresponds to the `--copy-source` parameter
of the [copy-object operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html).
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [copy-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html)
- [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html)

**[3]:** The `delete` attribute is only applicable to the [delete-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html) operation.
The `delete` attribute corresponds to the `--delete` parameter of the
[delete-objects operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-objects.html).

**[4]:** The `key` attribute is applicable to all object-related S3 operations, i.e. that require the object key as a mandatory parameter.
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [copy-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html)
- [delete-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html)
- [get-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/get-object.html)
- [head-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/head-object.html)
- [put-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html)
- [restore-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/restore-object.html)
- [select-object-content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/select-object-content.html)
- [abort-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html)
- [complete-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/complete-multipart-upload.html)
- [create-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/create-multipart-upload.html)
- [list-parts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/list-parts.html)
- [upload-part](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part.html)
- [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html)

**[5]:** The `part_number` attribute is only applicable to the [upload-part](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part.html)
and [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html) operations.
The `part_number` attribute corresponds to the `--part-number` parameter of the
[upload-part operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part.html).

**[6]:** The `upload_id` attribute applies to S3 multipart-upload operations and corresponds to the `--upload-id` parameter
of the [S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html) multipart operations.
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [abort-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html)
