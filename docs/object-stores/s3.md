**[1] `aws.s3.bucket`:** The `bucket` attribute is applicable to all S3 operations that reference a bucket, i.e. that require the bucket name as a mandatory parameter.
This applies to almost all S3 operations except `list-buckets`.

**[2] `aws.s3.copy_source`:** The `copy_source` attribute applies to S3 copy operations and corresponds to the `--copy-source` parameter
of the [copy-object operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html).
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [copy-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html)
- [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html)

**[3] `aws.s3.delete`:** The `delete` attribute is only applicable to the [delete-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html) operation.
The `delete` attribute corresponds to the `--delete` parameter of the
[delete-objects operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-objects.html).

**[4] `aws.s3.key`:** The `key` attribute is applicable to all object-related S3 operations, i.e. that require the object key as a mandatory parameter.
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [copy-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html)
- [delete-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html)
- [get-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/get-object.html)
- [head-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/head-object.html)
- [put-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html)
- [restore-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/restore-object.html)
- [select-object-content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/select-object-content.html)
- [abort-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html)
- [complete-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/complete-multipart-upload.html)
- [create-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/create-multipart-upload.html)

**[5] `aws.s3.part_number`:** The `part_number` attribute is only applicable to the [upload-part](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part.html)
and [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html) operations.
The `part_number` attribute corresponds to the `--part-number` parameter of the
[upload-part operation within the S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part.html).

**[6] `aws.s3.upload_id`:** The `upload_id` attribute applies to S3 multipart-upload operations and corresponds to the `--upload-id` parameter
of the [S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html) multipart operations.
This applies in particular to the following operations:

- [abort-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html)

- [upload-part-copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/upload-part-copy.html)

**[7] `rpc.method`:** This is the logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing method/function. The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to store the latter (e.g., method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub method on the client side).

**[8] `rpc.service`:** This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective, which can be different from the name of any implementing class. The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name; e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side, RPC client stub class on the client side).

`rpc.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
