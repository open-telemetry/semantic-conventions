**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents a client call to Generative AI model or service that generates a response or requests a tool call based on the input prompt.

**Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format
and MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.37.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
call to models running in the same process. It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind
when the GenAI system being instrumented usually runs in a different process than its
client or when the GenAI call happens over instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[6] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[9] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes tool execution span.

`gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `execute_tool`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `execute_tool {gen_ai.tool.name}`.

GenAI instrumentations that are able to instrument tool execution call SHOULD do so.
However, it's common for tools to be executed by the application code. It's recommended
for the application developers to follow this semantic convention for tools invoked
by the application code.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

## Capturing inputs and outputs

User inputs and model responses may be recorded as events parented to GenAI operation span. See [Semantic Conventions for GenAI events](./gen-ai-events.md) for the details.
