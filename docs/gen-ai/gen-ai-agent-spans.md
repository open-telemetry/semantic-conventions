Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent.

This document defines semantic conventions for GenAI agent calls that are defined by this [whitepaper](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents).

It MAY be applicable to agent operations that are performed by the GenAI framework locally.

The semantic conventions for GenAI agents extend and override the semantic conventions for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

## Spans

### Create Agent Span

Describes GenAI agent creation and is usually applicable when working with remote agent
services.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `create_agent`.

The **span name** SHOULD be `create_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[6] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `gen_ai.request.encoding_formats`:** In some GenAI systems the encoding formats are called embedding types. Also, some GenAI systems only accept a single format per request.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
