Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent.

This document defines semantic conventions for GenAI agent calls that are defined by this [whitepaper](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents).

It MAY be applicable to agent operations that are performed by the GenAI framework locally.

The semantic conventions for GenAI agents extend and override the semantic conventions for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

## Spans

### Create agent span

<!-- semconv span.gen_ai.create_agent.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes GenAI agent creation and is usually applicable when working with remote agent services.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `create_agent`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `create_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` |
| [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai`; `gcp.gen_ai`; `gcp.vertex_ai` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` if the operation ended in an error | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [3] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`gen_ai.agent.description`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | string | Free-form description of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Helps with math problems`; `Generates fiction stories` |
| [`gen_ai.agent.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` if applicable. | string | The unique identifier of the GenAI agent. | `asst_5j66UpCpwteGg4YSxUnt7lPY` |
| [`gen_ai.agent.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | string | Human-readable name of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Math Tutor`; `Fiction Writer` |
| [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. [4] | `gpt-4` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If `server.address` is set. | int | GenAI server port. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | GenAI server address. [6] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`gen_ai.system_instructions`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Opt-In` | any | The system message or instructions provided to the GenAI model separately from the chat history. | [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "text",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"content": "You are an Agent that greet users, always use greetings tool to respond"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>]; [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "text",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"content": "You are a language translator."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "text",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"content": "Your mission is to translate text in English to French."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>] |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)

### Invoke agent span

<!-- semconv span.gen_ai.invoke_agent.client -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes GenAI agent invocation.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `invoke_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}` if `gen_ai.agent.name` is readily available.
When `gen_ai.agent.name` is not available, it SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
invocation of agents running in the same process.
It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when the agent being instrumented usually runs
in a different process than its caller or when the agent invocation happens over
instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

Examples of span kinds for different agent scenarios:

- `CLIENT`: Remote agent services (e.g., OpenAI Assistants API, AWS Bedrock Agents)
- `INTERNAL`: In-process agents (e.g., LangChain agents, CrewAI agents)

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

- when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))
- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[5] `gen_ai.data_source.id`:** Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[8] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[9] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[10] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[11] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[12] `gen_ai.input.messages`:** Instrumentations MUST follow [Input messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-input-messages.json).
When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

Messages MUST be provided in the order they were sent to the model.
Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
input messages.

> [!Warning]
> This attribute is likely to contain sensitive information including user/PII data.

See [Recording content on attributes](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#recording-content-on-attributes)
section for more details.

**[13] `gen_ai.output.messages`:** Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)

Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by
the model. Each message corresponds to exactly one generation
(choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
output messages.

> [!Warning]
> This attribute is likely to contain sensitive information including user/PII data.

See [Recording content on attributes](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#recording-content-on-attributes)
section for more details.

**[14] `gen_ai.system_instructions`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the corresponding provider or API
allows to provide system instructions or messages separately from the
chat history.

Instructions that are part of the chat history SHOULD be recorded in
`gen_ai.input.messages` attribute instead.

Instrumentations MUST follow [System instructions JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-system-instructions.json).

When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
system instructions.

> [!Warning]
> This attribute may contain sensitive information.

See [Recording content on attributes](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#recording-content-on-attributes)
section for more details.

**[15] `gen_ai.tool.definitions`:** The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
populating this attribute.

The following attributes can be important for making sampling decisions
and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time** (if provided at all):

* [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md)
* [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
* [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md)
