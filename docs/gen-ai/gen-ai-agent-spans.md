Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent.

This document defines semantic conventions for GenAI agent calls that are defined by this [whitepaper](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents).

It MAY be applicable to agent operations that are performed by the GenAI framework locally.

The semantic conventions for GenAI agents extend and override the semantic conventions for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

## Spans

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes GenAI agent creation and is usually applicable when working with remote agent services.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `create_agent`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `create_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.system`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [3] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` if the operation ended in an error | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.description`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | Free-form description of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Helps with math problems`; `Generates fiction stories` | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The unique identifier of the GenAI agent. | `asst_5j66UpCpwteGg4YSxUnt7lPY` | `Conditionally Required` if applicable. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | Human-readable name of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Math Tutor`; `Fiction Writer` | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. [4] | `gpt-4` | `Conditionally Required` If available. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | GenAI server port. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` If `server.address` is set. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | GenAI server address. [6] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
