[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) is based on JSON RPC.

When instrumenting MCP calls, it's RECOMMENDED to follow MCP conventions instead of [RPC semantic conventions](/docs/rpc/README.md)
since MCP spans and metrics provide domain-specific context and record details
that are not covered by the RPC conventions such as message exchange within streaming calls.

HTTP conventions (when HTTP used as transport) do not adequately cover MCP requests
and notifications either, given that multiple MCP requests could be sent over single
HTTP request in the corresponding request and response streams.

## Spans

### Context propagation

Model Context Protocol works on top of JSON-RPC and does not define a standard
Trace Context propagation mechanism. MCP is transport independent and works across different transports. The specification expects clients to implement at least stdio or HTTP streams.

HTTP trace context propagation only covers the HTTP request, but not the individual
messages client and server exchange within the request/response streams.

Instrumentations SHOULD propagate trace context inside MCP request `params._meta`
property bag.

> [!NOTE]
> The propagation format defined here is likely to change. Please check out
> context propagation discussions in MCP repository:
> [modelcontextprotocol#246](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/246)
> and
> [modelcontextprotocol#414](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/414).
>
> If the MCP or JSON-RPC specifications provide official guidance, instrumentations
> SHOULD prioritize that over the recommendation provided in this section.

For example, when using [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) propagation,
inject `traceparent` and `tracestate` to the MCP message `params._meta` when creating request
or notification and extract them on the receiver side to use as the remote parent.

Here's an example of tool call request with injected trace context.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get-weather",
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
      "tracestate": "rojo=00f067aa0ba902b7,congo=t61rcWkgMzE"
    }
  },
  "id": 1,
}
```

Or, if user application uses [W3C Baggage](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) in addition
to the Trace-Context, `baggage` should be propagated in the same `params._meta`
property bag similarly to the following example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get-weather",
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
      "baggage": "userId=alice,serverNode=DF%2028,isProduction=false"
    }
  },
  "id": 1,
}
```

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span describes the MCP call from the client side.

It's reported by the MCP client when it initiates the request
or notification or by the MCP server when server initiates the operation.
It covers the time to receive the response or ack from the peer.

**Span name** SHOULD follow the format `{mcp.method.name} {target}`
where target SHOULD match `{gen_ai.tool.name}` or `{gen_ai.prompt.name}` when
applicable.
If there is no low-cardinality `target` available, the Span name SHOULD be `{mcp.method.name}`.

Instrumentation MAY allow users to opt into including `{mcp.resource.uri}`
as `target` in the span name when it is available but SHOULD NOT include it by default
to avoid high cardinality span names.

**Span status** SHOULD be set to `ERROR` when `error.type` attribute is present.
The status description SHOULD match the `JSONRPCError.message` if the message is available.

Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document
for more details.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

## Metrics

### Metric: `mcp.client.operation.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

This metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.50.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[3] `network.transport`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to `tcp` or `quic` if the transport protocol
is HTTP. It SHOULD be set to `pipe` if the transport is stdio.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `mcp.server.session.duration` | Histogram | `s` | The duration of the MCP session as observed on the MCP server. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |  |

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if session ends with an error. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`mcp.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/mcp.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The [version](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/versioning) of the Model Context Protocol used. | `2025-06-18` |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` When applicable. | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [2] | `http`; `websocket` |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` When applicable. | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. | `1.1`; `2` |
| [`network.transport`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | The transport protocol used for the MCP session. [3] | `tcp`; `quic`; `pipe` |
| [`rpc.jsonrpc.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/rpc.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` when it's not `2.0`. | string | The version of JSON-RPC protocol used. | `2.0`; `1.0` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[3] `network.transport`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to `tcp` or `quic` if the transport protocol
is HTTP. It SHOULD be set to `pipe` if the transport is stdio.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`network.transport` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `pipe` | Named or anonymous pipe. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `quic` | QUIC | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `tcp` | TCP | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `udp` | UDP | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `unix` | Unix domain socket | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Recording MCP transport

The following table shows how to capture MCP transport and can be used be telemetry
consumers to deduce transport type.

| MCP transport | `network.transport` attribute | `network.protocol.*` attributes | `mcp.protocol.version` attribute | comments |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| stdio         | `pipe`                        |                                 | any                              |          |
| Streamable HTTP | `tcp` (or `quic`)           | `network.protocol.name = http` <br> `network.protocol.version = 2` | `2025-06-18` or newer | `mcp.protocol.version` distinguishes streamable HTTP from SSE |
| HTTP with SSE   | `tcp` (or `quic`)           | `network.protocol.name = http` <br> `network.protocol.version = 1.1` (or 2) | `2024-11-05` or older | `mcp.protocol.version` distinguishes streamable HTTP from SSE |
| Custom: websockets | `tcp` (or another applicable protocol) | `network.protocol.name = websocket` | any            |          |
| Custom: gRPC | `tcp` (or another applicable protocol) | `network.protocol.name = http` <br> `network.protocol.version = 2` | any | See [gRPC conventions](/docs/rpc/grpc.md) for additional details |

Note: Applications may enable instrumentation for the underlying application protocol
like HTTP (when applicable) alongside MCP instrumentation to capture additional
transport-level details, such as transport-specific error codes.
