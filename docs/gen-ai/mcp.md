[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) is based on JSON RPC.

When instrumenting MCP calls, it's RECOMMENDED to follow MCP conventions instead of [RPC semantic conventions](/docs/rpc/README.md)
since MCP spans and metrics provide domain-specific context and record details
that are not covered by the RPC conventions such as message exchange within streaming calls.

HTTP conventions (when HTTP used as transport) do not adequately cover MCP requests
and notifications either, given that multiple MCP requests could be sent over single
HTTP request in the corresponding request and response streams.

## Spans

### Context propagation

Model Context Protocol works on top of JSON RPC and does not define a standard
Trace Context propagation mechanism. It also works on top of different transports
including stdio and HTTP streams.

HTTP trace context propagation only covers the HTTP request, but not the individual
messages client and server exchange within the request/response streams.

Instrumentations SHOULD propagate trace context inside MCP request `params._meta`
property bag.

> [!NOTE]
> The propagation format defined here is likely to change. Please check out
> context propagation discussions in MCP repository:
> [modelcontextprotocol#246](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/246)
> and
> [modelcontextprotocol#414](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/414).
>
> If the MCP or JSON-RPC specifications provide official guidance, instrumentations
> SHOULD prioritize that over the recommendation provided in this section.

For example, when using [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) propagation,
inject `traceparent` and `tracestate` to the MCP message `params._meta` when creating request
or notification and extract them on the receiver side to use as the remote parent.

Here's an example of tool call request with injected trace context.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get-weather",
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
      "tracestate": "rojo=00f067aa0ba902b7,congo=t61rcWkgMzE"
    }
  },
  "id": 1,
}
```

Or, if user application uses [W3C Baggage](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) in addition
to the Trace-Context, `baggage` should be propagated in the same `params._meta`
property bag similarly to the following example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get-weather",
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
      "baggage": "userId=alice,serverNode=DF%2028,isProduction=false"
    }
  },
  "id": 1,
}
```

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span describes the MCP call from the client side.

It's reported by the MCP client when it initiates the request
or notification or by the MCP server when server initiates the operation.
It covers the time to receive the response or ack from the peer.

**Span name** SHOULD follow the format `{mcp.method.name} {target}`
where target is the `{mcp.tool.name}`, `{mcp.prompt.name}` or `{mcp.resource.uri}`
depending on the request or notification type.

**Span status** SHOULD be set to `ERROR` using the same condition as the `error.type`
attribute. The status description SHOULD match the `JSONRPCError.message`
if the message is available.

Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document
for more details.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**[1] `error.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the string representation of the JSON RPC
error code, if one is returned.

When JSON RPC call is successful, but an error is returned within the
result payload, this attribute SHOULD be set to the low-cardinality
string representation of the error. When
[CallToolResult](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/9c8a44e47e16b789a1f9d47c89ea23ed13a37cf9/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts#L715)
is returned with `isError` set to `true`, this attribute SHOULD be set to
`tool_error`.

**[2] `mcp.resource.uri`:** This is a URI of the resource provided in the following requests or notifications: `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`, or `notifications/resources/updated`.

**[3] `mcp.resource.uri`:** When the client executes a request type that includes a resource URI parameter.

**[4] `network.transport`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to `tcp` or `quic` if the transport protocol
is HTTP.
It SHOULD be set to `pipe` if the transport is stdio.

**[5] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `mcp.request.argument.<key>`:** Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which arguments
are to be captured. Including all request arguments can be a security risk -
explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

Value type SHOULD match the value of the argument as passed in the request.

Examples:

- A `param.location` argument with value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.request.argument.location` attribute with value `"Seattle, WA"`.
- A `param.a` argument with value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.request.argument.a` attribute with value `42`.
- A `param.complex` argument with value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
  `mcp.request.argument.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.

When the attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
by the OpenTelemetry implementation.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[3] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
