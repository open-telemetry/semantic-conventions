# Semantic conventions for AWS Bedrock operations

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

> [!Warning]
>
> Existing GenAI instrumentations that are using
> [v1.36.0 of this document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.36.0/docs/gen-ai/README.md)
> (or prior):
>
> * SHOULD NOT change the version of the GenAI conventions that they emit by default.
>   Conventions include, but are not limited to, attributes, metric, span and event names,
>   span kind and unit of measure.
> * SHOULD introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`
>   as a comma-separated list of category-specific values. The list of values
>   includes:
>   * `gen_ai_latest_experimental` - emit the latest experimental version of
>     GenAI conventions (supported by the instrumentation) and do not emit the
>     old one (v1.36.0 or prior).
>   * The default behavior is to continue emitting whatever version of the GenAI
>     conventions the instrumentation was emitting (1.34.0 or prior).
>
> This transition plan will be updated to include stable version before the
> GenAI conventions are marked as stable.

## AWS Bedrock Spans

The Semantic Conventions for [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) extend and override the semantic conventions
for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

`gen_ai.provider.name` MUST be set to `"aws.bedrock"`.

These attributes track input data and metadata for a request to an AWS Bedrock model. The attributes include general Generative AI
attributes and ones specific the AWS Bedrock.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

-  when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))

- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[8] `gen_ai.tool.definitions`:** The value of this attribute matches provider-specific tool definition format. It's expected to be an object - in case a serialized string is available to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to deserialize it to an object.
Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable populating this attribute.

**[9] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[10] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[11] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
