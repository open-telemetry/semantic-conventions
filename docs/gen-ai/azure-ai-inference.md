# Semantic conventions for Azure AI Inference

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Azure AI Inference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio) extend and override the [GenAI Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Azure AI Inference Spans

`gen_ai.system` MUST be set to `"az.ai.inference"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[3] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the output type requested by the client: - `json` for structured outputs with defined or undefined schema - `image` for image output - `speech` for speech output - `text` for plain text output
The attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[4] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[5] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[6] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `az.namespace`:** When `az.namespace` attribute is populated, it MUST be set to `Microsoft.CognitiveServices` for all operations performed by Azure AI Inference clients.

**[8] `gen_ai.request.encoding_formats`:** In some GenAI systems the encoding formats are called embedding types. Also, some GenAI systems only accept a single format per request.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
