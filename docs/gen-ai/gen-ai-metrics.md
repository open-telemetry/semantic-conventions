## Generative AI client metrics

The conventions described in this section are specific to Generative AI client
applications.

**Disclaimer:** These are initial Generative AI client metric instruments
and attributes but more may be added in the future.

The following metric instruments describe Generative AI operations. An
operation may be a request to an LLM, a function call, or some other
distinct action within a larger Generative AI workflow.

Individual systems may include additional system-specific attributes.
It is recommended to check system-specific documentation, if available.

### Metric: `gen_ai.client.token.usage`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended] when an operation involves the usage
of tokens and the count is readily available.

For example, if GenAI system returns usage information in the streaming response, it SHOULD be used. Or if GenAI system returns each token independently, instrumentation SHOULD count number of output tokens and record the result.

If instrumentation cannot efficiently obtain number of input and/or output tokens, it MAY allow users to enable offline token counting. Otherwise it MUST NOT report usage metric.

When systems report both used tokens and billable tokens, instrumentation MUST report billable tokens.

This metric SHOULD be specified with [ExplicitBucketBoundaries] of [1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, 1048576, 4194304, 16777216, 67108864].

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `gen_ai.client.token.usage` | Histogram | `{token}` | Number of input and output tokens used. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` |
| [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai`; `gcp.gen_ai`; `gcp.vertex_ai` |
| [`gen_ai.token.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The type of token being counted. | `input`; `output` |
| [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. | `gpt-4` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If `server.address` is set. | int | GenAI server port. [3] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`gen_ai.response.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The name of the model that generated the response. | `gpt-4-0613` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | GenAI server address. [4] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

## Generative AI model server metrics

The following metric instruments describe Generative AI model servers'
operational metrics. It includes both functional and performance metrics.

### Metric: `gen_ai.server.request.duration`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended] to report the model server
latency in terms of time spent per request.

This metric SHOULD be specified with [ExplicitBucketBoundaries] of

### Metric: `gen_ai.server.time_per_output_token`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended] to report the model server
latency in terms of time per token generated after the first token for any model
servers which support serving LLMs. It is measured by subtracting the time taken
to generate the first output token from the request duration and dividing the
rest of the duration by the number of output tokens generated after the first
token. This is important in measuring the performance of the decode phase of LLM
inference.

This metric SHOULD be specified with [ExplicitBucketBoundaries] of
[0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5].

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` |
| [`gen_ai.provider.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai`; `gcp.gen_ai`; `gcp.vertex_ai` |
| [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If available. | string | The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. | `gpt-4` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If `server.address` is set. | int | GenAI server port. [3] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |
| [`gen_ai.response.model`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The name of the model that generated the response. | `gpt-4-0613` |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | GenAI server address. [4] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.provider.name`:** The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
but may proxy or host models from different providers.

The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
within GenAI semantic conventions.
It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
`openai.*` attributes.

**[3] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

### Metric: `gen_ai.server.time_to_first_token`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended] to report the model server
latency in terms of time spent to generate the first token of the response for
any model servers which support serving LLMs. It helps measure the time spent in
the queue and the prefill phase. It is important especially for streaming
requests. It is calculated at a request level and is reported as a histogram
using the buckets mentioned below.

This metric SHOULD be specified with [ExplicitBucketBoundaries] of
[0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0].
