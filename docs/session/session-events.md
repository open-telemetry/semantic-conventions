# Semantic conventions for session in events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The lifecycle of a session is communicated via events which are defined below.

## Session Events

### Event: `session.start`

<!-- semconv event.session.start -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `session.start`.

Indicates that a new session has been started, optionally linking to the prior session.

For instrumentation that tracks user behavior during user sessions, a `session.start` event MUST be emitted every time a session is created.

When the `session.start` event contains both `session.id` and `session.previous_id` fields, this indicates that the new session can be associated with the old session.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`session.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The ID of the new session being started. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` |
| [`session.previous_id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` [1] | string | The previous `session.id` for this user, when known. [2] | `00112234-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` |

**[1] `session.previous_id`:** If the new session is being created as a continuation of a previous session.

**[2] `session.previous_id`:** The `session.id` and `session.previous_id` attributes MUST have different values within the scope of an event.

If the session ID in `session.previous_id` has not yet ended via an explicit `session.end` event, then the consumer SHOULD treat this continuation event as semantically equivalent to `session.end(session.previous_id)` and `session.start(session.id)`.

### Event: `session.end`

<!-- semconv event.session.end -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `session.end`.

Indicates that a session has ended typically due to user inactivity or session timeout.

For instrumentation that tracks user behavior during user sessions, a `session.end` event SHOULD be emitted every time a session ends. When a session ends and continues as a new session, this event SHOULD be emitted prior to the `session.start` event.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`session.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/session.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The ID of the session being ended. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` |
