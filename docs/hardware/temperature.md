## Temperature metrics `hw.temperature.*`

A temperature sensor, either numeric or discrete.

`hw.type` MUST be set to `"temperature"` when using the common `hw.status` metric.

All temperature metrics may include the below attributes:

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Temperature limit in degrees Celsius.

The following attributes SHOULD be set:

- `hw.temperature.limit_type` SHOULD be set to indicate the type of limit, such as `"low.critical"`, `"low.degraded"`, `"high.degraded"`, or `"high.critical"`.

`hw.limit_type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

### Metric: `hw.status` (Temperature)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Whether the temperature is within normal range: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states.

When using this metric for temperature status, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"temperature"` to indicate that the status is for a temperature sensor.
- `hw.state` MUST be set to one of the following values to indicate the temperature state:
  - `"ok"`: The temperature is within normal range.
  - `"degraded"`: The temperature is outside the normal range but not critical.
  - `"failed"`: The temperature is at a critical level.

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `hw.status` | UpDownCounter | `1` | Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| [`hw.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The current state of the component | `degraded`; `failed`; `needs_cleaning` |
| [`hw.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | Type of the component [1] | `battery`; `cpu`; `disk_controller` |
| [`hw.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | An easily-recognizable name for the hardware component | `eth0` |
| [`hw.parent`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Unique identifier of the parent component (typically the `hw.id` attribute of the enclosure, or disk controller) | `dellStorage_perc_0` |

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.
