Hardware metrics do not include attributes that identify the device, machine, or host they are reported for. This
information is expected to be provided via resource attributes configured by user applications.
Application developers are encouraged to configure [Host](/docs/resource/host.md) resource attributes.

## Common hardware metrics

The below metrics apply to any type of hardware component.

These common `hw.` metrics include the below attributes to describe the
monitored component:

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`hw.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/hardware.md) | string | An identifier for the hardware component, unique within the monitored host | `win32battery_battery_testsysa33_1` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`hw.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/hardware.md) | string | Type of the component [1] | `battery`; `cpu`; `disk_controller` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`hw.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/hardware.md) | string | An easily-recognizable name for the hardware component | `eth0` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Metric: `hw.status`

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `hw.status` | UpDownCounter | `1` | Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.
