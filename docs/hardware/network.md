## Network metrics `hw.network.*`

A physical network interface, or a network interface controller (NIC), excluding software-based virtual adapters and loopbacks. For example, a physical network interface on a server, switch, router or firewall, an HBA, a fiber channel port or a Wi-Fi adapter.

`hw.type` MUST be set to `"network"`.

All network metrics may include the below attributes:

### Metric: `hw.errors` (Network)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Number of errors encountered by the network adapter.

When using this metric, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"network"` to indicate that the errors are from a network adapter.

The following attributes SHOULD be set:

- `error.type` SHOULD be set to indicate the type of error, such as `"zero_buffer_credit"`, `"crc"`, etc.
- `hw.network.direction` SHOULD be set to indicate the direction of the error, either `"receive"` or `"transmit"`.

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code reported by the component, the canonical name of the error, or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[3] `network.io.direction`:** This attribute SHOULD only be used when `hw.type` is set to `"network"` to indicate the direction of the error.

### Metric: `hw.status` (Network)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Operational status, regardless of the link status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states.

When using this metric for network status, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"network"` to indicate that the status is for a network adapter.
- `hw.state` MUST be set to one of the following values to indicate the network adapter state:
  - `"ok"`: The network adapter is operating normally.
  - `"degraded"`: The network adapter is operating with reduced functionality or performance.
  - `"failed"`: The network adapter has failed and is not operational.

| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `hw.status` | UpDownCounter | `1` | Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`hw.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | An identifier for the hardware component, unique within the monitored host | `win32battery_battery_testsysa33_1` |
| [`hw.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The current state of the component | `degraded`; `failed`; `needs_cleaning` |
| [`hw.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | Type of the component [1] | `battery`; `cpu`; `disk_controller` |
| [`hw.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | An easily-recognizable name for the hardware component | `eth0` |
| [`hw.parent`](/docs/registry/attributes/hardware.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Unique identifier of the parent component (typically the `hw.id` attribute of the enclosure, or disk controller) | `dellStorage_perc_0` |

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.
