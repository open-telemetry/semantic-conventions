## Logical disk metrics `hw.logical_disk.*`

Storage extent presented as a physical disk by a disk controller to the operating system (e.g. a RAID 1 set made of 2 disks, and exposed as /dev/hdd0 by the controller).

`hw.type` MUST be set to `"logical_disk"`.

All logical disk metrics may include the below attributes:

### Metric: `hw.errors` (Logical Disk)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Number of errors encountered on this logical disk.

When using this metric, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"logical_disk"` to indicate that the errors are from a logical disk.

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code reported by the component, the canonical name of the error, or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[3] `network.io.direction`:** This attribute SHOULD only be used when `hw.type` is set to `"network"` to indicate the direction of the error.

### Metric: `hw.status` (Logical Disk)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states.

When using this metric for logical disk status, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"logical_disk"` to indicate that the status is for a logical disk.
- `hw.state` MUST be set to one of the following values to indicate the logical disk state:
  - `"ok"`: The logical disk is operating normally.
  - `"degraded"`: The logical disk is operating with reduced functionality or performance.
  - `"failed"`: The logical disk has failed and is not operational.

<!-- semconv metric.hw.status -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `hw.status` | UpDownCounter | `1` | Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.

`hw.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
