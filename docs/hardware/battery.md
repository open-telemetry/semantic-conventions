## Battery metrics `hw.battery.*`

A battery in a computer system or an UPS.

`hw.type` MUST be set to `"battery"`.

All battery metrics may include the below attributes to describe the characteristics of the monitored battery:

### Metric: `hw.status` (Battery)

This metric is [recommended][MetricRecommended].

Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states.

When using this metric for battery status, the following attributes MUST be set:

- `hw.type` MUST be set to `"battery"` to indicate that the status is for a battery.
- `hw.state` MUST be set to one of the following values to indicate the battery state:
  - `"ok"`: The battery is operating normally.
  - `"degraded"`: The battery is operating with reduced functionality or performance.
  - `"failed"`: The battery has failed and is not operational.
  - `"charging"`: The battery is currently charging.
  - `"discharging"`: The battery is currently discharging.

The `hw.type` attribute should indicate the type of hardware component, which in this case is a battery. It should be set to "battery" to clearly identify the component being monitored.

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `hw.status` | UpDownCounter | `1` | Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**[1]:** `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.
