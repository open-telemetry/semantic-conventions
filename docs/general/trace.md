# Trace Semantic Conventions

**Status**: [Mixed][DocumentStatus]

In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementor to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.

The following semantic conventions for spans are defined:

* **[General](attributes.md): General semantic attributes that may be used in describing different kinds of operations.**
* [Compatibility](trace-compatibility.md): For spans generated by compatibility components, e.g. OpenTracing Shim layer.
* [CloudEvents](/docs/cloudevents/README.md): Semantic Conventions for the CloudEvents spans.
* [Cloud Providers](/docs/cloud-providers/README.md): Semantic Conventions for cloud providers spans.
* [Database](/docs/database/database-spans.md): For SQL and NoSQL client call spans.
* [Exceptions](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md): For recording exceptions associated with a span.
* [FaaS](/docs/faas/faas-spans.md): For [Function as a Service](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) (e.g., AWS Lambda) spans.
* [Feature Flags](/docs/feature-flags/feature-flags-spans.md): For recording feature flag evaluations associated with a span.
* [HTTP](/docs/http/http-spans.md): For HTTP client and server spans.
* [Messaging](/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md): For messaging systems (queues, publish/subscribe, etc.) spans.
* [Object Stores](/docs/object-stores/README.md): Semantic Conventions for object stores spans.
* [RPC/RMI](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md): For remote procedure call (e.g., gRPC) spans.

Apart from semantic conventions for traces, [metrics](metrics.md), [logs](logs.md), and [events](events.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.31.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/resource/README.md).
