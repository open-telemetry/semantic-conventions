# Trace semantic conventions

**Status**: [Mixed][DocumentStatus]

In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementer to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.

The following semantic conventions for spans are defined:

* [CloudEvents](/docs/cloudevents/README.md): Semantic Conventions for the CloudEvents spans.
* [Cloud Providers](/docs/cloud-providers/README.md): Semantic Conventions for cloud providers spans.
* [Database](/docs/database/database-spans.md): For SQL and NoSQL client call spans.
* [Exceptions](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md): For recording exceptions associated with a span.
* [FaaS](/docs/faas/faas-spans.md): For [Function as a Service](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) (e.g., AWS Lambda) spans.
* [HTTP](/docs/http/http-spans.md): For HTTP client and server spans.
* [Messaging](/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md): For messaging systems (queues, publish/subscribe, etc.) spans.
* [Object Stores](/docs/object-stores/README.md): Semantic Conventions for object stores spans.
* [RPC/RMI](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md): For remote procedure call (e.g., gRPC) spans.

Apart from semantic conventions for traces, [metrics](metrics.md), [logs](logs.md), and [events](events.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/resource/README.md).

## General Attributes

The attributes described in this section are not specific to a particular operation but rather generic.
They may be used in any Span they apply to.
Particular operations may refer to or require some of these attributes.

### Peer

Operations that access some remote service. 

Users can define what the name of a service is based on their particular semantics in their distributed system. Instrumentations SHOULD provide a way for users to configure this name.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`peer.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/peer.md) | string | The [`service.name`](/docs/resource/README.md#service) of the remote service. SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name` resource attribute of the remote service if any. | `AuthTokenCache` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Thread

These attributes may be used for any operation to store information about a thread that started a span. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`thread.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | int | Current "managed" thread ID (as opposed to OS thread ID). | `42` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`thread.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | string | Current thread name. | `main` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

## Compatibility

### OpenTracing

`Link`s created by the OpenTracing Shim MUST set `opentracing.ref_type`
with one of the accepted values, describing the direct causal relationships
between a child Span and a parent Span, as defined by
[OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md).

<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`opentracing.ref_type`](/docs/registry/attributes/opentracing.md) | string | Parent-child Reference type [1] | `child_of`; `follows_from` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `opentracing.ref_type`:** The causal relationship between a child Span and a parent Span.

---

`opentracing.ref_type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `child_of` | The parent Span depends on the child Span in some capacity | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `follows_from` | The parent Span doesn't depend in any way on the result of the child Span | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
