In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementer to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.
