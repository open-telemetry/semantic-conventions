# Trace semantic conventions

**Status**: [Mixed][DocumentStatus]

In OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and it’s up to the implementer to
annotate them with attributes specific to the represented operation. Spans
represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls.
Depending on the protocol and the type of operation, additional information
is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages.
This way, the operator will not need to learn specifics of a language and
telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments
can still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.

The following semantic conventions for spans are defined:

* **[General](attributes.md): General semantic attributes that may be used in describing different kinds of operations.**
* [CloudEvents](/docs/cloudevents/README.md): Semantic Conventions for the CloudEvents spans.
* [Cloud Providers](/docs/cloud-providers/README.md): Semantic Conventions for cloud providers spans.
* [Database](/docs/database/database-spans.md): For SQL and NoSQL client call spans.
* [Exceptions](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md): For recording exceptions associated with a span.
* [FaaS](/docs/faas/faas-spans.md): For [Function as a Service](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) (e.g., AWS Lambda) spans.
* [HTTP](/docs/http/http-spans.md): For HTTP client and server spans.
* [Messaging](/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md): For messaging systems (queues, publish/subscribe, etc.) spans.
* [Object Stores](/docs/object-stores/README.md): Semantic Conventions for object stores spans.
* [RPC/RMI](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md): For remote procedure call (e.g., gRPC) spans.

Apart from semantic conventions for traces, [metrics](metrics.md), [logs](logs.md), and [events](events.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.51.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/resource/README.md).

## Compatibility

This section defines trace semantic conventions used by the
compatibility components, e.g. OpenTracing Shim layer.

### OpenTracing

`Link`s created by the OpenTracing Shim MUST set `opentracing.ref_type`
with one of the accepted values, describing the direct causal relationships
between a child Span and a parent Span, as defined by
[OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md).

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`opentracing.ref_type`](/docs/registry/attributes/opentracing.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Parent-child Reference type [1] | `child_of`; `follows_from` |

**[1] `opentracing.ref_type`:** The causal relationship between a child Span and a parent Span.

---

`opentracing.ref_type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `child_of` | The parent Span depends on the child Span in some capacity | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `follows_from` | The parent Span doesn't depend in any way on the result of the child Span | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
