# Semantic conventions for events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document describes the characteristics of standalone Events that are represented
in the data model by `LogRecord`s.

Semantically, an Event is a named occurrence at an instant in time. It signals that
"this thing happened at this time" and provides additional specifics about the occurrence.
Examples of Events might include things like button clicks, user logout,
network connection severed, etc.

In OpenTelemetry, Events are implemented as a specific type of [`LogRecord`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/logs/api.md) that conforms to the conventions included here.

OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions that define events SHOULD document the event name along
with attributes and the type of the body if any.

## General event semantics

* An event MUST have an [Event name property](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-eventname)
  that uniquely identifies the event. Event names are subject to the [Naming guidelines](/docs/general/naming.md). Event name SHOULD be of a low-cardinality.
* Events MAY have [attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-attributes)
  that provide additional context about the event.
* Events MAY contain a [body](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-body) of type [`any`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.49.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#type-any).
* The event name uniquely identifies event structure: the set of attributes and
  the type of the body.
* Events MAY have [severity number](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-severitynumber).

It's RECOMMENDED to use the collection of attributes to represent the details of
the event.

<!-- Body use cases are not clear - see https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1651 for the context.-->

## General Attributes

The attributes described in this section are not specific to a particular operation but may be used in any event.

### Thread

These attributes may be used for any operation to store information about a thread that started a span. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`thread.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | int | Current "managed" thread ID (as opposed to OS thread ID). | `42` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`thread.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | string | Current thread name. | `main` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Code

Often a signal ie Span/Event, is closely tied to a certain unit of code that is logically responsible for handling the operation that the signal is for. These attributes allow the unit of code to be reported and therefore to provide more context. 

In the case of a span this would usually be the method that starts the span and for events/logs it is the method emitting the signal.
For an HTTP server span, this would be the function that handles the incoming request, for example.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`code.column.number`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | int | The column number in `code.file.path` best representing the operation. It SHOULD point within the code unit named in `code.function.name`. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Line'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `16` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.file.path`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | The source code file name that identifies the code unit as uniquely as possible (preferably an absolute file path). This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Function'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `/usr/local/MyApplication/content_root/app/index.php` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.function.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | The method or function fully-qualified name without arguments. The value should fit the natural representation of the language runtime, which is also likely the same used within `code.stacktrace` attribute value. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Function'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. [1] | `com.example.MyHttpService.serveRequest`; `GuzzleHttp\Client::transfer`; `fopen` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.line.number`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | int | The line number in `code.file.path` best representing the operation. It SHOULD point within the code unit named in `code.function.name`. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Line'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `42` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.stacktrace`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | A stacktrace as a string in the natural representation for the language runtime. The representation is identical to [`exception.stacktrace`](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md#stacktrace-representation). This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Location'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodB(GenerateTrace.java:13)\n at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodA(GenerateTrace.java:9)\n at com.example.GenerateTrace.main(GenerateTrace.java:5)` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `code.function.name`:** Values and format depends on each language runtime, thus it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of examples.
The values are usually the same (or prefixes of) the ones found in native stack trace representation stored in
`code.stacktrace` without information on arguments.

Examples:

* Java method: `com.example.MyHttpService.serveRequest`
* Java anonymous class method: `com.mycompany.Main$1.myMethod`
* Java lambda method: `com.mycompany.Main$$Lambda/0x0000748ae4149c00.myMethod`
* PHP function: `GuzzleHttp\Client::transfer`
* Go function: `github.com/my/repo/pkg.foo.func5`
* Elixir: `OpenTelemetry.Ctx.new`
* Erlang: `opentelemetry_ctx:new`
* Rust: `playground::my_module::my_cool_func`
* C function: `fopen`

## Compatibility

When recording events from an existing system as OpenTelemetry Events, the system
may lack a single name field or require multiple fields to identify the event.
In such cases, use a combination of fields to create a low-cardinality event name.
