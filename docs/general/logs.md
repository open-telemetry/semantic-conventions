# General logs attributes

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The attributes described in this section are rather generic.
They may be used in any Log Record they apply to.

The following semantic conventions for logs are defined:

* [Exceptions](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-logs.md): Semantic attributes that may be used in describing exceptions in logs.

Apart from semantic conventions for logs, [events](events.md), [traces](trace.md), and [metrics](metrics.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/resource/README.md).

## General Attributes

The attributes described in this section are not specific to a particular operation but may be used in any log record.

### Log Record

The attributes described in this section are rather generic. They may be used in any Log Record they apply to. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`log.record.original`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The complete original Log Record. [1] | `77 <86>1 2015-08-06T21:58:59.694Z 192.168.2.133 inactive - - - Something happened`; `[INFO] 8/3/24 12:34:56 Something happened` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`log.record.uid`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | A unique identifier for the Log Record. [2] | `01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `log.record.original`:** This value MAY be added when processing a Log Record which was originally transmitted as a string or equivalent data type AND the Body field of the Log Record does not contain the same value. (e.g. a syslog or a log record read from a file.)

**[2] `log.record.uid`:** If an id is provided, other log records with the same id will be considered duplicates and can be removed safely. This means, that two distinguishable log records MUST have different values.
The id MAY be an [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier (ULID)](https://github.com/ulid/spec), but other identifiers (e.g. UUID) may be used as needed.

### Log file

A file to which log was emitted. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`log.file.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The basename of the file. | `audit.log` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### I/O Stream

The I/O stream to which the log was emitted. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`log.iostream`](/docs/registry/attributes/log.md) | string | The stream associated with the log. See below for a list of well-known values. | `stdout`; `stderr` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`log.iostream` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `stderr` | Events from stderr stream | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `stdout` | Logs from stdout stream | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Peer

Operations that access some remote service. 

Users can define what the name of a service is based on their particular semantics in their distributed system. Instrumentations SHOULD provide a way for users to configure this name.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`peer.service`](/docs/registry/attributes/peer.md) | string | The [`service.name`](/docs/resource/README.md#service) of the remote service. SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name` resource attribute of the remote service if any. | `AuthTokenCache` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Thread

These attributes may be used for any operation to store information about a thread that started a span. 

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`thread.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | int | Current "managed" thread ID (as opposed to OS thread ID). | `42` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`thread.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/thread.md) | string | Current thread name. | `main` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Code

Often a signal ie Span/Event, is closely tied to a certain unit of code that is logically responsible for handling the operation that the signal is for. These attributes allow the unit of code to be reported and therefore to provide more context. 

In the case of a span this would usually be the method that starts the span and for events/logs it is the method emitting the signal.
For an HTTP server span, this would be the function that handles the incoming request, for example.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`code.column.number`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | int | The column number in `code.file.path` best representing the operation. It SHOULD point within the code unit named in `code.function.name`. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Line'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `16` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.file.path`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | The source code file name that identifies the code unit as uniquely as possible (preferably an absolute file path). This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Function'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `/usr/local/MyApplication/content_root/app/index.php` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.function.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | The method or function fully-qualified name without arguments. The value should fit the natural representation of the language runtime, which is also likely the same used within `code.stacktrace` attribute value. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Function'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. [1] | `com.example.MyHttpService.serveRequest`; `GuzzleHttp\Client::transfer`; `fopen` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.line.number`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | int | The line number in `code.file.path` best representing the operation. It SHOULD point within the code unit named in `code.function.name`. This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Line'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `42` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`code.stacktrace`](/docs/registry/attributes/code.md) | string | A stacktrace as a string in the natural representation for the language runtime. The representation is identical to [`exception.stacktrace`](/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md#stacktrace-representation). This attribute MUST NOT be used on the Profile signal since the data is already captured in 'message Location'. This constraint is imposed to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity. | `at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodB(GenerateTrace.java:13)\n at com.example.GenerateTrace.methodA(GenerateTrace.java:9)\n at com.example.GenerateTrace.main(GenerateTrace.java:5)` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `code.function.name`:** Values and format depends on each language runtime, thus it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of examples.
The values are usually the same (or prefixes of) the ones found in native stack trace representation stored in
`code.stacktrace` without information on arguments.

Examples:

* Java method: `com.example.MyHttpService.serveRequest`
* Java anonymous class method: `com.mycompany.Main$1.myMethod`
* Java lambda method: `com.mycompany.Main$$Lambda/0x0000748ae4149c00.myMethod`
* PHP function: `GuzzleHttp\Client::transfer`
* Go function: `github.com/my/repo/pkg.foo.func5`
* Elixir: `OpenTelemetry.Ctx.new`
* Erlang: `opentelemetry_ctx:new`
* Rust: `playground::my_module::my_cool_func`
* C function: `fopen`
