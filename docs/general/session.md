# Semantic conventions for session

**Status**: [Experimental][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions to apply to client-side applications when tracking sessions.

Session is defined as the period of time encompassing all activities performed by the application and the actions
executed by the end user.

Consequently, a Session is represented as a collection of Logs, Events, and Spans emitted by the Client Application
throughout the Session's duration. Each Session is assigned a unique identifier, which is included as an attribute in
the Logs, Events, and Spans generated during the Session's lifecycle.

## Attributes

<!-- semconv session-id -->
| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `session.id` | string | A unique id to identify a session. | `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` | Opt-In |
