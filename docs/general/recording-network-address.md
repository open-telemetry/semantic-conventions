# Recording Network Addresses

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

These attributes may be used to describe the client and server in a connection-based network interaction
where there is one side that initiates the connection (the client is the side that initiates the connection).
This covers all TCP network interactions since TCP is connection-based and one side initiates the
connection (an exception is made for peer-to-peer communication over TCP where the "user-facing" surface of the
protocol / API does not expose a clear notion of client and server).
This also covers UDP network interactions where one side initiates the interaction, e.g. QUIC (HTTP/3) and DNS.

In an ideal situation, not accounting for proxies, multiple IP addresses or host names,
the `server.*` attributes are the same on the client and server.

## Address and port attributes

For all IP-based protocols, the "address" should be just the IP-level address.
Protocol-specific parts of an address are split into other attributes (when applicable) such as "port" attributes for
TCP and UDP.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | int | Server port number. [2] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

`server.address` and `server.port` represent logical server name and port. Semantic conventions that refer to these attributes SHOULD
specify what these attributes mean in their context.

#### `server.address`

For IP-based communication, the name should be a DNS host name of the service. On client side it matches remote service name, on server side, it represents local service name as seen externally on clients.

When connecting to an URL `https://example.com/foo`, `server.address` matches `"example.com"` on both client and server side.

On client side, it's usually passed in form of URL, connection string, host name, etc. Sometimes host name is only available to instrumentation as a string which may contain DNS name or IP address. `server.address` SHOULD be set to the available known hostname (e.g., `"127.0.0.1"` if connecting to an URL `https://127.0.0.1/foo`).

If only IP address is available, it should be populated on `server.address`. Reverse DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used to obtain DNS name.

If `network.transport` is `"pipe"`, the absolute path to the file representing it should be used as `server.address`.
If there is no such file (e.g., anonymous pipe),
the name should explicitly be set to the empty string to distinguish it from the case where the name is just unknown or not covered by the instrumentation.

For Unix domain socket, `server.address` attribute represents remote endpoint address on the client side and local endpoint address on the server side.

**[1] `client.address`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.address` SHOULD represent the client address behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `client.port`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.port` SHOULD represent the client port behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

### `source.*`

These attributes may be used to describe the sender of a network exchange/packet. These should be used
when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown.
This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if
there was a connection or which side initiated it.
This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the
"user-facing" surface of the protocol / API does not expose a clear notion of client and server.

### `destination.*`

These attributes may be used to describe the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used
when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown.
This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if
there was a connection or which side initiated it.
This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the
"user-facing" surface of the protocol / API does not expose a clear notion of client and server.

### `network.peer.*` and `network.local.*`

These attributes identify network peers that are directly connected to each other.

`network.peer.address` and `network.local.address` should be IP addresses, Unix domain socket names, or other addresses specific to network type.

_Note: Specific structures and methods to obtain socket-level attributes are mentioned here only as examples. Instrumentations would usually use Socket API provided by their environment or sockets implementations._

When connecting using `connect(2)` ([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect))
or `bind(2)`([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-bind))
with `AF_INET` address family, `network.peer.address` and `network.peer.port` represent `sin_addr` and `sin_port` fields
of `sockaddr_in` structure.

`network.peer.address` and `network.peer.port` can be obtained by calling `getpeername` method
([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-getpeername)).

`network.local.address` and `network.local.port` can be obtained by calling `getsockname` method
([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockname.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-getsockname)).
