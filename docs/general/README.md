# General semantic conventions

This document defines general Semantic Conventions for spans, metrics, logs and events.

The following general guides for Semantic Convention signals are defined:

* [Events](events.md): General Semantic Conventions for events.
* [Logs](logs.md): General Semantic Conventions for logs.
* [Metrics](metrics.md): General Semantic Conventions for metrics.
* [Profiles](general/profiles.md): Semantic Conventions for profiles.
* [Spans](trace.md): General Semantic Conventions for traces / spans.

Apart from semantic conventions for traces, [metrics](metrics.md), [logs](logs.md), and [events](events.md),
OpenTelemetry also defines the concept of overarching [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.49.0/specification/resource/sdk.md) with their own
[Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/resource/README.md).
