## Server, client and shared network attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the client and server in a connection-based network interaction
where there is one side that initiates the connection (the client is the side that initiates the connection).
This covers all TCP network interactions since TCP is connection-based and one side initiates the
connection (an exception is made for peer-to-peer communication over TCP where the "user-facing" surface of the
protocol / API does not expose a clear notion of client and server).
This also covers UDP network interactions where one side initiates the interaction, e.g. QUIC (HTTP/3) and DNS.

In an ideal situation, not accounting for proxies, multiple IP addresses or host names,
the `server.*` attributes are the same on the client and server.

### Address and port attributes

For all IP-based protocols, the "address" should be just the IP-level address.
Protocol-specific parts of an address are split into other attributes (when applicable) such as "port" attributes for
TCP and UDP. If such transport-specific information is collected and the attribute name does not already uniquely
identify the transport, then setting [`network.transport`](#other-network-attributes) is especially encouraged.

### Server attributes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Attributes in this section are in use by the HTTP semantic conventions.
Once the HTTP semantic conventions are declared stable, changes to the attributes in this section will only be allowed
if they do not cause breaking changes to HTTP semantic conventions.

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Recommended` | int | Server port number. [2] | `80`; `8080`; `443` |

**[1] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- END AUTOGENERATED TEXT -->
<!-- endsemconv -->

`server.address` and `server.port` represent logical server name and port. Semantic conventions that refer to these attributes SHOULD
specify what these attributes mean in their context.

#### `server.address`

For IP-based communication, the name should be a DNS host name of the service. On client side it matches remote service name, on server side, it represents local service name as seen externally on clients.

When connecting to an URL `https://example.com/foo`, `server.address` matches `"example.com"` on both client and server side.

On client side, it's usually passed in form of URL, connection string, host name, etc. Sometimes host name is only available to instrumentation as a string which may contain DNS name or IP address. `server.address` SHOULD be set to the available known hostname (e.g., `"127.0.0.1"` if connecting to an URL `https://127.0.0.1/foo`).

If only IP address is available, it should be populated on `server.address`. Reverse DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used to obtain DNS name.

If `network.transport` is `"pipe"`, the absolute path to the file representing it should be used as `server.address`.
If there is no such file (e.g., anonymous pipe),
the name should explicitly be set to the empty string to distinguish it from the case where the name is just unknown or not covered by the instrumentation.

For Unix domain socket, `server.address` attribute represents remote endpoint address on the client side and local endpoint address on the server side.

### Client attributes

**[1] `client.address`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.address` SHOULD represent the client address behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `client.port`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.port` SHOULD represent the client port behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

### Source and destination attributes

These attributes may be used to describe the sender and receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used
when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown.
This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if
there was a connection or which side initiated it.
This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the
"user-facing" surface of the protocol / API does not expose a clear notion of client and server.

**[2] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[3] `network.transport`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since
a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport. For example
different processes could be listening on TCP port 12345 and UDP port 12345.

**[4] `network.type`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

#### `network.peer.*` and `network.local.*` attributes

These attributes identify network peers that are directly connected to each other.

`network.peer.address` and `network.local.address` should be IP addresses, Unix domain socket names, or other addresses specific to network type.

_Note: Specific structures and methods to obtain socket-level attributes are mentioned here only as examples. Instrumentations would usually use Socket API provided by their environment or sockets implementations._

When connecting using `connect(2)` ([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect))
or `bind(2)`([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-bind))
with `AF_INET` address family, `network.peer.address` and `network.peer.port` represent `sin_addr` and `sin_port` fields
of `sockaddr_in` structure.

`network.peer.address` and `network.peer.port` can be obtained by calling `getpeername` method
([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-getpeername)).

`network.local.address` and `network.local.port` can be obtained by calling `getsockname` method
([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockname.2.html) /
[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-getsockname)).

##### Client/server examples using `network.peer.*`

Note that `network.local.*` attributes are not included in these examples since they are typically Opt-In.

For `Unix` and `pipe`, since the connection goes over the file system instead of being directly to a known peer, `server.address` is the only attribute that usually makes sense (see description of `server.address` below).

## General remote service attributes

This attribute may be used for any operation that accesses some remote service.
Users can define what the name of a service is based on their particular semantics in their distributed system.
Instrumentations SHOULD provide a way for users to configure this name.

SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name` resource attribute of the remote service if any. [1] | `AuthTokenCache` |

**[1] `peer.service`:** Examples of `peer.service` that users may specify:

- A Redis cache of auth tokens as `peer.service="AuthTokenCache"`.
- A gRPC service `rpc.service="io.opentelemetry.AuthService"` may be hosted in both a gateway, `peer.service="ExternalApiService"` and a backend, `peer.service="AuthService"`.

## Source code attributes

**Status**: [Release Candidate][DocumentStatus]

Often a span is closely tied to a certain unit of code that is logically responsible for handling
the operation that the span describes (usually the method that starts the span).
For an HTTP server span, this would be the function that handles the incoming request, for example.
The [code attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/code/) allow to report this unit of code
and therefore to provide more context.
