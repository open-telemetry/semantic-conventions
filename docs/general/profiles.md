# Profiles

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

## Useful Additional Attribute Namespaces

There are some attribute namespaces which can be used to provide additional context and
are not specific to a particular domain. Such as:

* [Profile](/docs/registry/attributes/profile.md)

They may be used in any Profiles record they apply to.

## Compatibility

### PPROF

Existing [pprof][pprofLink] formats can be unambiguously mapped to the OperTelemetry data
model. Reverse mapping from this data model is also possible to the extent that
the target profiles format has equivalent capabilities. To achieve this the [PPROF attributes](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) are used and are described below.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`pprof.location.is_folded`](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) | boolean | Provides an indication that multiple symbols map to this location's address, for example due to identical code folding by the linker. In that case the line information represents one of the multiple symbols. This field must be recomputed when the symbolization state of the profile changes. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`pprof.mapping.has_filenames`](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) | boolean | Indicates that there are filenames related to this mapping. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`pprof.mapping.has_functions`](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) | boolean | Indicates that there are functions related to this mapping. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`pprof.mapping.has_inline_frames`](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) | boolean | Indicates that there are inline frames related to this mapping. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`pprof.mapping.has_line_numbers`](/docs/registry/attributes/pprof.md) | boolean | Indicates that there are line numbers related to this mapping. |  | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
