.NET `HttpClient` reports HTTP client request spans according to [HTTP Semantic Conventions](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-client).

In addition to HTTP request spans, `HttpClient` reports spans describing HTTP connection establishment and its stages.

While such spans represent low-level details, connection lifetime is usually measured in minutes, therefore in common case
when application is under the load, the rate of connection-related spans is expected to be much lower than the rate of HTTP client spans.

Application developers are encouraged to enable corresponding instrumentation in development or test environments. Using connection-level
instrumentation in production should be done after appropriate validation as it increases the volume of reported telemetry and has performance overhead that
depends on the application.

## HTTP client request

.NET `HttpClient` reports client request spans according to [HTTP Client Semantic Conventions](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-client) with the following
specific details:

- `network.protocol.name`, `network.peer.port`, and `http.request.resend_count` are not reported
- `url.full` is redacted by default - query parameter values are replaced with `*`. Redaction can be disabled by setting `AppContext` switch `System.Net.Http.DisableQueryRedaction` to `true`.
- all attributes are reported after `Activity` is started, none are provided at creation time.

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.Http`.
Span with HTTP semantics was added in .NET Core 9.

## HTTP client request: wait for connection

The span describes the time it takes for the HTTP request to obtain a connection from the connection pool.
The span is reported only if there is no connection that's readily available. It's reported as a child of *HTTP client request* span.

The span ends when the connection is obtained - it could happen when an existing connection becomes available or once
a new connection is established, so the duration of *Wait For Connection* span is different from duration of the [*HTTP connection setup*](#http-connection-setup) span.

If a new connection was created to serve the request and the corresponding [*HTTP connection setup*](#http-connection-setup) was reported, the instrumentation adds the
link to the *HTTP connection setup* from the *Wait for connection* span.

Span name SHOULD be `wait_for_connection {server.address}:{server.port}`.

Span kind SHOULD be `INTERNAL`

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.Http.ConnectionLink.WaitForConnection`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.Http.ConnectionLink`.
Span added in .NET Core 9.

The time it takes to get a connection from the pool is also reported by the
[`http.client.request.time_in_queue` metric](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-http-metrics.md#metric-httpclientrequesttime_in_queue).

The span describes the establishment of the HTTP connection. It includes the time it takes
to resolve the DNS, establish the socket connection, and perform the TLS handshake.

Span name SHOULD be `HTTP connection_setup {address}:{server.port}`.
The `{address}` SHOULD be `server.address` when it's available and `network.peer.address` otherwise.

Span kind SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.Http.Connections.ConnectionSetup`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.Http.Connections`.

## Socket connect

The span describes the establishment of the socket connection.
It's different from [*HTTP connection setup*](#http-connection-setup) span, which also covers the DNS lookup and TLS handshake.

When *Socket connect* span is reported along with *HTTP connection setup* span, the socket span becomes a child of HTTP connection setup.

Span name SHOULD be `socket connect {network.peer.address}:{network.peer.port}`.
Span kind SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.Sockets.Connect`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.Sockets`.
Added in .NET Core 9.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Socket error code. [1] | `connection_refused`; `address_not_available` | `Conditionally Required` if and only if an error has occurred. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.peer.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The following errors codes are reported:

- `network_down`
- `address_already_in_use`
- `interrupted`
- `in_progress`
- `already_in_progress`
- `address_not_available`

## DNS resolution

The span describes DNS lookups performed with one of the methods on [System.Net.Dns](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.dns) class.
DNS lookup duration is also reported by [`dns.lookup.duration` metric](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-dns-metrics.md#metric-dnslookupduration).

DNS spans track logical operations rather than physical DNS calls and the actual behavior depends on the resolver implementation which could be changed in the future versions of .NET.
.NET 9 uses OS DNS resolver which may do zero or more physical lookups for one API call.

When *DNS* span is reported along with *HTTP connection setup* and *Socket connect* span, the *DNS* span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*
and a sibling of *Socket connect*.

DNS spans are reported for both lookups and reverse lookups.

Lookup (IP addresses from host name) span name SHOULD be `DNS lookup {dns.question.name}`. TODO?
Reverse lookup (host names from IP address) span name SHOULD be `DNS reverse lookup {dns.question.name}`.
Span kind SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.NameResolution.DnsLookup`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.NameResolution`.
Added in .NET Core 9

## TLS handshake

The span describes TLS client or server handshake performed with [System.Net.Security.SslStream](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream).

Span name SHOULD be `TLS client {server.address}` when authenticating on the client side and `TLS server` when authenticating the server.
Span kind SHOULD be `CLIENT` in both cases.

When *TLS* span is reported for client-side authentication along with *HTTP connection setup* and *Socket connect* span, the *TLS* span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*.

Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `System.Net.Security.TlsHandshake`, `ActivitySource` name - `System.Net.Security`.
Added in .NET Core 9.

## Examples

### HTTP request was performed on a connection that was immediately available

If connection is immediately available for the request, `HttpClient` creates one span for HTTP request.

```
<------------------ GET / (CLIENT, trace=t1, span=s1) --------------------------->
```

### HTTP request has to wait for connection setup

If connection was not immediately available for the request, `HttpClient` creates span for HTTP request and
*Wait for connection* span. In this example, a new connection was created and the request was executed on it immediately after
connection was created. There was no cached DNS record for the host.

```
<----------------------- GET / (trace=t1, span=s1) -------------------------------->
<-- wait_for_connection (trace=t1, span=s2, link_to=t2,s3) -->


<--------- HTTP connection_setup (trace=t2, span=s3) -------->
<--- DNS --->
             <--------- socket connect -------->
                                                <--- TLS --->
```

### HTTP request has to wait for connection setup and other requests on that connection to complete

If connection was not immediately available for the request, `HttpClient` creates span for HTTP request and
*Wait for connection* span. In this example, request was performed on a new connection, but before this connection
became available for this request, other requests were performed on it.

```
                <--------------------- GET / (trace=t1, span=s1) ------------------------------>
                <---- wait_for_connection (trace=t1, span=s2, link_to=t2,s3) ---->


<--- HTTP connection_setup - (trace=t2, span=s3) --->
<-- DNS -->
           <------ socket connect ------->
                                          <-- TLS -->
```

The *HTTP connection_setup* has started before this request, it also ended much earlier than
*Wait for connection* span, indicating that there is a queue of requests and high demand for
connections in the pool.
