## Server

## Routing

All routing metrics are reported by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing` meter.

### Metric: `aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts`

<!-- semconv metric.aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts` | Counter | `{match_attempt}` | Number of requests that were attempted to be matched to an endpoint. [1] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | |

**[1]:** Meter name: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing`; Added in: ASP.NET Core 8.0

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`aspnetcore.routing.match_status`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Required` | string | Match result - success or failure | `success`; `failure` |
| [`aspnetcore.routing.is_fallback`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` if and only if a route was successfully matched. | boolean | A value that indicates whether the matched route is a fallback route. | `true` |
| [`http.route`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` if and only if a route was successfully matched. | string | The matched route template for the request. This MUST be low-cardinality and include all static path segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders. [1] | `/users/:userID?`; `my-controller/my-action/{id?}` |

**[1] `http.route`:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

---

`aspnetcore.routing.match_status` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `failure` | Match failed | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
