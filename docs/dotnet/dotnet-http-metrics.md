## HTTP client

All Http client metrics are reported by the `System.Net.Http` meter.

### Metric: `http.client.request.duration`

Client request duration measures the time it takes to receive response headers and doesn't include time to read the response body.

This metric follows the common [http.client.request.duration](../http/http-metrics.md#metric-httpclientrequestduration) definition.

Notes:

- Meter name is `System.Net.Http`
- Metric added in .NET 8.0
- When the `error.type` attribute is reported, it contains one of [HTTP Request errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httprequesterror) in snake_case, a full exception type, or a string representation of received status code.
- `network.protocol.name` is not reported and should always be assumed to match `http`.
- `server.port` is not reported when it matches a default one for provided scheme (`443` for `https` and `80` for `http`)
- `url.scheme` is always reported.

### Metric: `http.client.open_connections`

<!-- Tables in this document are not auto-generated and are intentionally frozen in time. From the .NET perspective this metric and its attributes are stable till the next major version. They are still experimental in the OpenTelemetry. -->
| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `http.client.open_connections` | UpDownCounter | `{connection}` | Number of outbound HTTP connections that are currently active or idle on the client. [1] |

**[1]:** Meter name: `System.Net.Http`; Added in: .NET 8.0

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `http.connection.state` | string | State of the HTTP connection in the HTTP connection pool. | `active`; `idle` | Required |
| [`network.peer.address`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | Remote IP address of the socket connection. | `10.1.2.80` | Recommended |
| [`network.protocol.version`](../attributes-registry/network.md) | string | The negotiated version of the protocol associated with connection in the connection pool. [1] | `1.1`; `2`; `3` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | string | Host identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [2] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Required |
| [`server.port`](../attributes-registry/server.md) | int | Port identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [3] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditionally Required: [4] |
| [`url.scheme`](../attributes-registry/url.md) | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https`; `ftp` | Recommended |

**[1]:** HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 requests share connections in the connection pool and are both reported as version `1.1`. So, the `network.protocol.version` value reported on connection metrics is different than the one reported on request-level metrics or spans for HTTP 1.0 requests.

**[2]:** If an HTTP client request is explicitly made to an IP address, e.g. `http://x.x.x.x:8080`, then `server.address` SHOULD be the IP address `x.x.x.x`. A DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used.

**[3]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[4]:** If not the default (`80` for `http` scheme, `443` for `https`).

`http.connection.state` MUST be one of the following:

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `active` | active state. |
| `idle` | idle state. |

### Metric: `http.client.connection.duration`

this metric SHOULD be specified with

## HTTP server

All HTTP server metrics are reported by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting` meter.

### Metric: `http.server.request.duration`

Measures time to last byte. This metric follows the common [http.server.request.duration](../http/http-metrics.md#metric-httpserverrequestduration) definition.

Notes:

- Meter name is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting`
- Metric added in ASP.NET Core 8.0
- Opt-in `server.address` and `server.port` attributes are not reported
- Additional attributes:

  - The `aspnetcore.request.is_unhandled` boolean attribute is reported when the request was **not** handled by the application pipeline. It's skipped otherwise.

### Metric: `http.server.active_requests`

Measures the number of HTTP requests that are currently active on the server. This metric follows the common [http.server.active_requests](../http/http-metrics.md#metric-httpserveractive_requests) definition.

Notes:

- Meter name is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting`
- Opt-in `server.address` and `server.port` attributes are not reported
- Metric added in ASP.NET Core 8.0
