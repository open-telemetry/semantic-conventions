## HTTP client

All Http client metrics are reported by the `System.Net.Http` meter.

### Metric: `http.client.request.duration`

Client request duration measures the time it takes to receive response headers and doesn't include time to read the response body.

This metric follows the common [http.client.request.duration](../http/http-metrics.md#metric-httpclientrequestduration) definition.

Notes:

- Meter name is `System.Net.Http`
- Metric added in .NET 8.0
- When the `error.type` attribute is reported, it contains one of [HTTP Request errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httprequesterror) in snake_case, a full exception type, or a string representation of received status code.
- `network.protocol.name` is not reported and should always be assumed to match `http`.
- `server.port` is not reported when it matches a default one for provided scheme (`443` for `https` and `80` for `http`)
- `url.scheme` is always reported.

### Metric: `http.client.open_connections`

### Metric: `http.client.request.time_in_queue`

this metric SHOULD be specified with
[`ExplicitBucketBoundaries`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.48.0/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-advisory-parameters)
of `[ 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 ]`.

<!-- Tables in this document are not auto-generated and are intentionally frozen in time. From the .NET perspective this metric and its attributes are stable till the next major version. They are still experimental in the OpenTelemetry. -->
| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `http.client.request.time_in_queue` | Histogram | `s` | The amount of time requests spent on a queue waiting for an available connection. [1] |

**[1]:** Meter name: `System.Net.Http`; Added in: .NET 8.0

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Requirement Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`http.request.method`](../registry/attributes/http.md) | string | HTTP request method. [1] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | Recommended |
| [`network.protocol.version`](../registry/attributes/network.md) | string | The negotiated version of the protocol associated with connection in the connection pool. [2] | `1.1`; `2`; `3` | Recommended |
| [`server.address`](../registry/attributes/server.md) | string | Host identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [3] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | Required |
| [`server.port`](../registry/attributes/server.md) | int | Port identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. [4] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | Conditionally Required: [5] |
| [`url.scheme`](../registry/attributes/url.md) | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https`; `ftp` | Recommended |

**[1]:** HTTP request method value is one of the "known" methods listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods) and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).
If the HTTP request method isn't known, it sets the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`. It's not possible at the moment to override the list of known HTTP methods.

**[2]:** HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 requests share connections in the connection pool and are both reported as version `1.1`. So, the `network.protocol.version` value reported on connection metrics is different than the one reported on request-level metrics or spans for HTTP 1.0 requests.

**[3]:** If an HTTP client request is explicitly made to an IP address, e.g. `http://x.x.x.x:8080`, then `server.address` SHOULD be the IP address `x.x.x.x`. A DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used.

**[4]:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[5]:** If not the default (`80` for `http` scheme, `443` for `https`).

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used, otherwise a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description |
|---|---|
| `CONNECT` | CONNECT method. |
| `DELETE` | DELETE method. |
| `GET` | GET method. |
| `HEAD` | HEAD method. |
| `OPTIONS` | OPTIONS method. |
| `PATCH` | PATCH method. |
| `POST` | POST method. |
| `PUT` | PUT method. |
| `TRACE` | TRACE method. |
| `_OTHER` | Any HTTP method that the instrumentation has no prior knowledge of. |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | string | Server domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

| [`url.template`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | string | The low-cardinality template of an [absolute path reference](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.2). [3] | `/users/{id}`; `/users/:id`; `/users?id={id}` | `Conditionally Required` If available. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`http.request.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md) | string | HTTP request method. [4] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`url.scheme`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `server.address`:** In HTTP/1.1, when the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#name-request-target)
is passed in its [absolute-form](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-3.2.2),
the `server.address` SHOULD match the host component of the request target.

In all other cases, `server.address` SHOULD match the host component of the
`Host` header in HTTP/1.1 or the `:authority` pseudo-header in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

**[2] `server.port`:** In the case of HTTP/1.1, when the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#name-request-target)
is passed in its [absolute-form](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-3.2.2),
the `server.port` SHOULD match the port component of the request target.

In all other cases, `server.port` SHOULD match the port component of the
`Host` header in HTTP/1.1 or the `:authority` pseudo-header in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

**[3] `url.template`:** The `url.template` MUST have low cardinality. It is not usually available on HTTP clients, but may be known by the application or specialized HTTP instrumentation.

**[4] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

---

`http.request.method` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |

## HTTP server

All HTTP server metrics are reported by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting` meter.

### Metric: `http.server.request.duration`

Notes:

- Meter name is `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting`
- Metric added in ASP.NET Core 8.0
- Additional attributes:

  - The `aspnetcore.request.is_unhandled` boolean attribute is reported when the request was **not** handled by the application pipeline. It's skipped otherwise.

| [`http.route`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md) | string | The matched route, that is, the path template in the format used by the respective server framework. [4] | `/users/:userID?`; `{controller}/{action}/{id?}` | `Conditionally Required` If and only if it's available | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.protocol.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | [OSI application layer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. [5] | `http`; `spdy` | `Conditionally Required` [6] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`network.protocol.version`](/docs/registry/attributes/network.md) | string | The actual version of the protocol used for network communication. [7] | `1.0`; `1.1`; `2`; `3` | `Recommended` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | string | Name of the local HTTP server that received the request. [8] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[2] `url.scheme`:** The scheme of the original client request, if known (e.g. from [Forwarded#proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded#proto), [X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto), or a similar header). Otherwise, the scheme of the immediate peer request.

**[3] `error.type`:** If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
`error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
`error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
additional filters are applied.

If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

**[4] `http.route`:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

**[5] `network.protocol.name`:** The value SHOULD be normalized to lowercase.

**[6] `network.protocol.name`:** If not `http` and `network.protocol.version` is set.

**[7] `network.protocol.version`:** If protocol version is subject to negotiation (for example using [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301.html)), this attribute SHOULD be set to the negotiated version. If the actual protocol version is not known, this attribute SHOULD NOT be set.

**[8] `server.address`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).
> **Warning**
> Since this attribute is based on HTTP headers, opting in to it may allow an attacker
> to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.

**[9] `server.port`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).
> **Warning**
> Since this attribute is based on HTTP headers, opting in to it may allow an attacker
> to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.

**[10] `user_agent.synthetic.type`:** This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`http.request.method`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md) | string | HTTP request method. [1] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`url.scheme`](/docs/registry/attributes/url.md) | string | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | string | Name of the local HTTP server that received the request. [2] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/registry/attributes/server.md) | int | Port of the local HTTP server that received the request. [3] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Opt-In` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `http.request.method`:** HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

**[2] `server.address`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).
> **Warning**
> Since this attribute is based on HTTP headers, opting in to it may allow an attacker
> to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.

**[3] `server.port`:** See [Setting `server.address` and `server.port` attributes](/docs/http/http-spans.md#setting-serveraddress-and-serverport-attributes).
> **Warning**
> Since this attribute is based on HTTP headers, opting in to it may allow an attacker
> to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.
