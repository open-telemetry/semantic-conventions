# Add Area Experts

**What is the target semantic convention area?**

You can either request a new area to be created or add experts to an existing area. The project maintainers will decide whether there are sufficient area experts before starting a new area. Check the current [domain experts coverage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).

**Who should be added?**

List out the individuals who should be added. Provide the following information.

* Full name
* GitHub alias
* Why is this individual a good fit for the area?

Please make sure that you confirm with the individuals before adding them. We need the individuals to explictly reply to the GitHub issue confirming their willingness. Normally we expect the individuals to have contributed to the area in the past, and we expect to have at least one expert who is affliated with the area.
