# Semantic Convention Areas

Semantic conventions in OpenTelemetry are organized into distinct areas,
with some of them being overseen by Special Interest Group (SIG).

Non-trivial changes to semantic conventions require the creation of a
project, which may or may not also require the formation of a SIG.

To learn more about the process of creating a new project and form a SIG,
refer to the
[Project Management](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/project-management.md)
guide in the Community repository.

SIGs have several responsibilities and goals, but their primary focus is to
define and guide semantic conventions toward stabilization. SIGs that achieve their goal
may be dissolved, but the codeowner group stays serving as domain experts
for pull request (PR) reviews and issue triage.

This document provides an overview of the semantic conventions areas, along with
their owners, related project (and project board) as well as its current status.
