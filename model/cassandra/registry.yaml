    attributes:
      - id: cassandra.coordinator.dc
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The data center of the coordinating node for a query.
        examples: "us-west-2"
      - id: cassandra.coordinator.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The ID of the coordinating node for a query.
        examples: "be13faa2-8574-4d71-926d-27f16cf8a7af"
      - id: cassandra.consistency.level
        brief: >
          The consistency level of the query. Based on consistency values from [CQL](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html).
        type:
          members:
            - id: all
              value: "all"
              brief: All of the replicas must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: each_quorum
              value: "each_quorum"
              brief: A majority of the replicas in each datacenter must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: quorum
              value: "quorum"
              brief: A majority (n/2 + 1) of the replicas must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: local_quorum
              value: "local_quorum"
              brief: A majority of the replicas in the local datacenter (whichever datacenter the coordinator is in) must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: one
              value: "one"
              brief: Only a single replica must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: two
              value: "two"
              brief: Two replicas must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: three
              value: "three"
              brief: Three replicas must respond.
              stability: development
            - id: local_one
              value: "local_one"
              brief: Only a single replica must respond. In a multi-datacenter cluster, this also guarantees that read requests are not sent to replicas in a remote datacenter.
              stability: development
            - id: any
              value: "any"
              brief: >
                A single replica may respond, or the coordinator may store a hint.
                If a hint is stored, the coordinator will later attempt to replay the hint and deliver the mutation to the replicas.
                This consistency level is only accepted for write operations.
              stability: development
            - id: serial
              value: "serial"
              brief: This consistency level is only for use with lightweight transaction. Equivalent to QUORUM.
              stability: development
            - id: local_serial
              value: "local_serial"
              brief: Same as SERIAL but used to maintain consistency locally (within the single datacenter). Equivalent to LOCAL_QUORUM.
              stability: development
        stability: development
      - id: cassandra.query.idempotent
        type: boolean
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Whether or not the query is idempotent.
      - id: cassandra.page.size
        type: int
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The fetch size used for paging, i.e. how many rows will be returned at once.
        examples: [5000]
      - id: cassandra.speculative_execution.count
        type: int
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The number of times a query was speculatively executed. Not set or `0` if the query was not executed speculatively.
        examples: [0, 2]
