    attributes:
      - id: db.collection.name
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
          in non-batch operations.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
          collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.
        examples: ["public.users", "customers"]
      - id: db.namespace
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: >
          The name of the database, fully qualified within the server address and port.
        note: >
          If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated
          from the most general to the most specific namespace component,
          using `|` as a separator between the components.
          Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
          means in the context of that system.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
        examples: ["customers", "test.users"]
      - id: db.operation.name
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: >
          The name of the operation or command being executed.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
          in non-batch operations.

          If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
          SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
          then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.
        examples: ["findAndModify", "HMSET", "SELECT"]
      - id: db.query.text
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: >
          The database query being executed.
        note: >
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text
          then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated
          with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized.
          Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query
          the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit
          to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
        examples:
          [
            "SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = ?",
            'SET mykey ?',
          ]
      - id: db.query.parameter
        type: template[string]
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name,
          and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        note: |
          If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Examples:

          - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
            the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
            `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

        examples: ["someval", "55"]
      - id: db.query.summary
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: >
          Low cardinality summary of a database query.
        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.
        examples:
          [
            'SELECT wuser_table',
            'INSERT shipping_details SELECT orders',
            'get user by id',
          ]
      - id: db.stored_procedure.name
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: The name of a stored procedure within the database.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
          stored procedure name then that stored procedure name SHOULD be used.
        examples: ["GetCustomer"]
      - id: db.operation.parameter

        stability: development
        brief: >
          A database operation parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name,
          and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        note: |
          For example, a client-side maximum number of rows to read from the database
          MAY be recorded as the `db.operation.parameter.max_rows` attribute.

          `db.query.text` parameters SHOULD be captured using `db.query.parameter.<key>`
          instead of `db.operation.parameter.<key>`.
        examples: ["someval", "55"]
      - id: db.operation.batch.size
        type: int
        stability: stable
        brief: The number of queries included in a batch operation.
        note: >
          Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations,
          and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
        examples: [2, 3, 4]
      - id: db.response.status_code
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: Database response status code.
        note: >
          The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code,
          but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate
          between various types of successful outcomes.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what
          `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
        examples: ["102", "ORA-17002", "08P01", "404"]
      - id: db.response.returned_rows

        brief: The database management system (DBMS) product as identified by the client instrumentation.
        note: >
          The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client.
          For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name`
          is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.
