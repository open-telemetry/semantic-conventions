  - id: span.db.client
    type: span
    stability: stable
    brief: This span describes database client call.
    note: |
      Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
      the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
      For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
      span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

      When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
      (e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
      it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
      These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
      readily available at the generic query level.

      **Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      in-memory database calls.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when database system being instrumented usually
      runs in a different process than its client or when database calls happen over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      **Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
      Semantic conventions for individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
      classify as errors.

        note: |
          When connected to a default instance, `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the name of
          the database. When connected to a [named instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/connect/jdbc/building-the-connection-url#named-and-multiple-sql-server-instances),
          `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the combination of instance and database name following the `{instance_name}|{database_name}` pattern.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DB_NAME()`),
          then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation MAY use the user name when the connection was established as a stand-in for the schema name.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the user provided when the connection was established.

      The SQL databases Semantic Conventions describes how common [Database Semantic Conventions](/docs/db/database-spans.md) apply to SQL databases.
    note: |
      The following database systems (defined in the
      [`db.system.name`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#notes-and-well-known-identifiers-for-dbsystemname) set)
      are known to use SQL as their primary query language:

      - `actian.ingres`
      - `cockroachdb`
      - `derby`
      - `firebirdsql`
      - `h2database`
      - `hsqldb`
      - `ibm.db2`
      - `mariadb`
      - `microsoft.sql_server`
      - `mysql`
      - `oracle.db`
      - `other_sql`
      - `postgresql`
      - `sap.maxdb`
      - `sqlite`
      - `trino`

      Many other database systems support SQL and can be accessed via generic database driver such as JDBC or ODBC.
      Instrumentations applied to generic SQL drivers SHOULD adhere to SQL semantic conventions.

      **Span name** SHOULD follow the general [database span name convention](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name)
    attributes:
      - ref: db.namespace
        brief: >
          The database associated with the connection,
          fully qualified within the server address and port.
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If available without an additional network call.
        note: |
          If a database system has multiple namespace components (e.g. schema name and database name), they SHOULD be concatenated
          from the most general to the most specific namespace component,
          using `|` as a separator between the components.
          Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
          means in the context of that system.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DATABASE()`),
          then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
      - ref: db.response.status_code
        brief: >
          Database response code recorded as a string.
        note: |
          SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
          return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
          See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
          for the details.

          Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
          error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
          For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
          class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

          Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
          the most specific code available to them.

          Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
          codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
          at all):

          - [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
          - [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/)
          - [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
          - [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
          - [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
          - [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

          These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
          known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
          it SHOULD be used.

          When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
          instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
          concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

          For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
          SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
          `db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

          If none of them applies, it's RECOMMENDED to use language-agnostic representation of
          client method name in snake_case. Instrumentations SHOULD document
          additional values when introducing new operations.

        requirement_level:
          recommended: >
            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless explicitly configured
            and sanitized to exclude sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present
            in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text MUST also NOT be collected by default unless explicitly configured.
            The query parameter values themselves are opt-in,
            see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](../registry/attributes/db.md)).
        note: >
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used,
          otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        examples: ["SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = :mykey"]
