                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
        examples: ['timeout', 'java.net.UnknownHostException', 'server_certificate_invalid', '500']
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          * Use a domain-specific attribute
          * Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
