        note: >
          Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.31.0/specification/common/attribute-naming.md).
          Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean
          separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and
          kubernetes.
        examples: ['browser.mouse.click', 'device.app.lifecycle']
