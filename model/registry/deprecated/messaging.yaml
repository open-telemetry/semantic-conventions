                One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary.
                If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created.

                A message is created.
                "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch publishing scenarios.

                This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages.
