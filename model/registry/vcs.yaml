        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The revision, literally [revised version](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revision),
          The revision most often refers to a commit object in Git, or a revision number in SVN.
        note: |
          The revision can be a full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
          commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
          not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a
          [revision number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
          which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
          it is identical to the `ref.name`, it SHOULD still be included. It is
          up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the revision
          based on the VCS system and situational context.
        examples:
          [
            "9d59409acf479dfa0df1aa568182e43e43df8bbe28d60fcf2bc52e30068802cc",
            "main",
            "123",
            "HEAD",
          ]
      - id: change.title
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The human readable title of the change (pull request/merge request).
          This title is often a brief summary of the change and may get merged
          in to a ref as the commit summary.
        examples:
          [
            "Fixes broken thing",
            "feat: add my new feature",
            "[chore] update dependency",
          ]
      - id: change.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The ID of the change (pull request/merge request) if applicable. This
          is usually a unique (within repository) identifier generated by the VCS system.
        examples: ["123"]
