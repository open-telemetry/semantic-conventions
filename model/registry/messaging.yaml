        type: int
        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        note: >
            Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message.
            When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD
            use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.
        examples: [0, 1, 2]

        type: string
        brief: 'The message destination name'
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']
        tag: messaging-generic
      - id: destination.template
        type: string
        brief: Low cardinality representation of the messaging destination name
        note: >
          Destination names could be constructed from templates.
          An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id.
          Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality,
          the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively
          used for grouping and aggregation.
        examples: ['/customers/{customerId}']

        brief: 'The name of the original destination the message was published to'
        note: |
          The name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic, or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the original destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']

        brief: >
          Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.
          They differ from `messaging.message.id` in that they're not unique.
          If the key is `null`, the attribute MUST NOT be set.
        note: >
          If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute.
          If the key has no unambiguous, canonical string form, don't include its value.

                If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created.
