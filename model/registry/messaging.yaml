    attributes:
      - id: batch.message_count
        type: int
        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        note: >
            Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message.
            When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD
            use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.
        examples: [0, 1, 2]
      - id: client_id
        type: string
        brief: >
          A unique identifier for the client that consumes or produces a message.
        examples: ['client-5', 'myhost@8742@s8083jm']
      - id: destination.name
        type: string
        brief: 'The message destination name'
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']
      - id: destination.template
        type: string
        brief: Low cardinality representation of the messaging destination name
        note: >
          Destination names could be constructed from templates.
          An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id.
          Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality,
          the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively
          used for grouping and aggregation.
        examples: ['/customers/{customerId}']
      - id: destination.anonymous
        type: boolean
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the message destination is anonymous (could be unnamed or have auto-generated name).'
      - id: destination.temporary
        type: boolean
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the message destination is temporary and might not exist anymore after messages are processed.'
      - id: destination_publish.anonymous
        type: boolean
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the publish message destination is anonymous (could be unnamed or have auto-generated name).'
      - id: destination_publish.name
        type: string
        brief: 'The name of the original destination the message was published to'
        note: |
          The name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic, or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the original destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']
      - id: kafka.consumer.group
        type: string
        brief: >
          Name of the Kafka Consumer Group that is handling the message.
          Only applies to consumers, not producers.
        examples: 'my-group'
      - id: kafka.destination.partition
        type: int
        brief: >
          Partition the message is sent to.
        examples: 2
      - id: kafka.message.key
        type: string
        brief: >
          Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.
          They differ from `messaging.message.id` in that they're not unique.
          If the key is `null`, the attribute MUST NOT be set.
        note: >
          If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute.
          If the key has no unambiguous, canonical string form, don't include its value.
        examples: 'myKey'
      - id: kafka.message.offset
        type: int
        brief: >
          The offset of a record in the corresponding Kafka partition.
        examples: 42
      - id: kafka.message.tombstone
        type: boolean
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the message is a tombstone.'
      - id: message.conversation_id
        type: string
        brief: >
          The conversation ID identifying the conversation to which the message belongs,
          represented as a string. Sometimes called "Correlation ID".
        examples: 'MyConversationId'
      - id: message.envelope.size
        type: int
        brief: >
          The size of the message body and metadata in bytes.
        note: |
          This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
          size should be used.
        examples: 2738
      - id: message.id
        type: string
        brief: 'A value used by the messaging system as an identifier for the message, represented as a string.'

      - id: message.body.size
        type: int
        brief: >
          The size of the message body in bytes.
        note: |
          This can refer to both the compressed or uncompressed body size. If both sizes are known, the uncompressed
          body size should be used.

            - id: publish
              value: "publish"
              brief: >
                One or more messages are provided for publishing to an intermediary.
                If a single message is published, the context of the "Publish" span can be used as the creation context and no "Create" span needs to be created.
            - id: create
              value: "create"
              brief: >
                A message is created.
                "Create" spans always refer to a single message and are used to provide a unique creation context for messages in batch publishing scenarios.
            - id: receive
              value: "receive"
              brief: >
                One or more messages are requested by a consumer.
                This operation refers to pull-based scenarios, where consumers explicitly call methods of messaging SDKs to receive messages.
            - id: deliver
              value: "deliver"
              brief: >
                One or more messages are passed to a consumer.
                This operation refers to push-based scenarios, where consumer register callbacks which get called by messaging SDKs.
        brief: >
          A string identifying the kind of messaging operation.
        note: If a custom value is used, it MUST be of low cardinality.
