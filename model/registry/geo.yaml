    brief: >
      Geo fields can carry data about a specific location related to an event.
      This geolocation information can be derived from techniques such as Geo IP, or be user-supplied.

      Note: Geo attributes are typically used under another namespace, such as client.* and describe the location of the corresponding
      entity (device, end-user, etc). Semantic conventions that reference geo attributes (as a root namespace) or embed them
      (under their own namespace) SHOULD document what geo attributes describe in the scope of that convention.
