          SHOULD be a semantic identifier for a value. If one is unavailable, a
          stringified version of the value can be used.
        note: |-
          A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
          for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
          provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
          For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

          A stringified version of the value can be used in situations where a
          semantic identifier is unavailable. String representation of the value
          should be determined by the implementer.
