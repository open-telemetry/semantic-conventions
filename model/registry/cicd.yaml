    brief: >
      This group describes attributes specific to pipelines within a Continuous
      Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system. A
      [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in this
      case is a series of steps that are performed in order to deliver a new
      version of software. This aligns with the
      [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pipeline) definition
      of a pipeline where a **pipeline** is the system for developing and
      producing something. In the context of CI/CD, a pipeline produces or
      delivers software.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The human readable name of the pipeline within a CI/CD system.
        examples: ['Build and Test', 'Lint', 'Deploy Go Project', 'deploy_to_environment']
      - id: run.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The unique identifier of a pipeline run within a CI/CD system.
        examples: ['120912']
      - id: task.name
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The human readable name of a task within a pipeline. Task here most
          closely aligns with a [computing process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing))
          in a pipeline. Other terms for tasks include commands, steps, and
          procedures.
        examples: ['Run GoLang Linter', 'Go Build', 'go-test', 'deploy_binary']
      - id: task.run.id
        type: string
