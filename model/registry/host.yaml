      A host is defined as a computing instance. For example, physical servers, virtual machines, switches or disk array.
    attributes:
      - id: id

        brief: >
          Unique host ID. For Cloud, this must be the instance_id assigned by the cloud provider.
          For non-containerized systems, this should be the `machine-id`. See the table below for
          the sources to use to determine the `machine-id` based on operating system.
