          This should represent the `name` field of the GetPluginInfo RPC.
        examples:
          - "pd.csi.storage.gke.io"
      - id: csi.volume.id

        brief: >
          The unique volume ID returned by the CSI plugin.
        note: >
          This can sometimes be referred to as a "volume handle" in CSI implementations.
          This should represent the `Volume.volume_id` field in CSI spec.

          - "projects/my-gcp-project/zones/my-gcp-zone/disks/my-gcp-disk"
