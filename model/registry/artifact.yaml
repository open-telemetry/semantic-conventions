groups:
  - id: registry.artifact
    prefix: artifact
    type: attribute_group
    brief: >
      This group describes attributes specific to artifacts. Artifacts are
      files or other immutable objects that are intended for distribution. This
      definition aligns directly with the
      [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model) package
      model.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The human readable file name of the artifact, often generated by
          build and release utilities to include the package name and version.
        examples:
          [
            "golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0",
            "docker-image-amd64-v0.1.0",
            "release-1.tar.gz",
            "file-name-package.tar.gz",
          ]
      - id: version
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The version of the artifact.
        examples: ["v0.1.0", "1.2.1", "122691-build"]
      - id: purl
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) of the
          artifact, providing a standard way to identify and locate the
          artifact.
        examples:
          [
            "pkg:github/package-url/purl-spec@1209109710924",
            "pkg:npm/foo@12.12.3",
          ]
      - id: hash
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          often found in checksum.txt on a release of the artifact and used to
          verify package integrity.
        note: |
          The specific algorithm used to create the cryptographic hash value is
          not defined. In situations where an artifact has many cryptographic
          hashes, it is up to the implementer to choose which hash value to set
          here; ideally that which is most secure, situationally ideal, and
          consistent with the corresponding attestation. The implementer can
          then provide the other hash values through an additional set of
          attribute extensions as they deem necessary.
        examples:
          ["9ff4c52759e2c4ac70b7d517bc7fcdc1cda631ca0045271ddd1b192544f8a3e9"]
      - id: attestation.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The id of the build [software attestation](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model).
        examples: ["123"]
      - id: attestation.filename
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The provenance filename of the built attestation which directly
          relates to the build artifact filename. This filename SHOULD
          accompany the artifact at publish time. See the
          [SLSA Relationship](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/distributing-provenance#relationship-between-artifacts-and-attestations)
          specification for more information.
        examples:
          [
            "golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0.attestation",
            "docker-image-amd64-v0.1.0.intoto.json1",
            "release-1.tar.gz.attestation",
            "file-name-package.tar.gz.intoto.json1",
          ]
      - id: attestation.hash
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          of the built attestation. Some envelopes in the software attestation
          space also refer to this as the [digest](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md#in-toto-attestation-framework-spec).
        examples:
          ["1b31dfcd5b7f9267bf2ff47651df1cfb9147b9e4df1f335accf65b4cda498408"]
