    attributes:

        type: string
        brief: >
          The name of the cluster.
        examples: ['opentelemetry-cluster']
      - id: cluster.uid
        type: string
        brief: >
          A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system`
          namespace.
        note: |
          K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
          added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
          official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
          `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
          rationale.

          Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
          `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
          for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
          namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
          change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
          UUIDs as standardized by
          [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
          Which states:

          > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
            ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
            different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
            extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

          Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
          conflict.
