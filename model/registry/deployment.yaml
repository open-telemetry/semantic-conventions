    brief: >
     This document defines attributes for software deployments.

      - id: environment

        brief: >
          Name of the [deployment environment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment)
          (aka deployment tier).
        note: |
          `deployment.environment` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
          the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
          This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
          considered to be identifying the same service:

          * `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment=production`
          * `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment=staging`.
        examples: ['staging', 'production']
