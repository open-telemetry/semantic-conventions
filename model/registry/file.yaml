        type: string
        brief: >
          Time when the file attributes or metadata was last changed, in ISO 8601 format.
        note: >
          This attribute is not supported on all file systems. Note that changes to the
          file content will update `mtime`. This implies `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since
          `mtime` is an attribute of the file.

        examples: ['2021-01-01T12:00:00Z']
      - id: directory
        type: string
        brief: >
          Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate.
        stability: experimental
        examples: ['/home/user', 'C:\Program Files\MyApp']
      - id: drive_letter
        type: string
        brief: >
          Drive letter where the file is located.
        note: >
          This attribute is only applicable to Windows systems.
          The value should be uppercase, and not include the colon.
        stability: experimental

      - id: extension

        brief: >
          File extension, excluding the leading dot.
        stability: experimental
        examples: ['png', 'gz']
        note: >
          When the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should
          be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
      - id: fork_name
        type: string
        brief: >
          Name of the fork. A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
        note: >
          On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at
          least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.

          On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is
          just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet.
          An ADS is typically of the form: C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name, and some_fork_name is the
          value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension`
          should populate `file.extension`. The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.
