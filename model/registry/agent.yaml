          Agent type.

        note: >
          A string that uniquely identifies the agent type. A recommended way to choose
          a value is to pick a reverse FQDN of a domain that is under the control of the
          agent's author. Must remain unchanged between different versions of the same
          agent type.

      - id: distro
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          Agent distribution.
        examples: [github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector, github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector]
        note: >
          Identifies the distribution of the agent. A number of
          distributions can belong to the same `agent.type`. For example OpenTelemetry
          Collector has multiple known distributions, e.g.
          github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector,
          github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector, etc.
          The value is typically a URL where the agent's source code is hosted
          (without the preceding http/https scheme). However other approaches for choosing
          `agent.distro` values are also valid (e.g. reverse FQDN).

      - id: version
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The version string of the agent. The format is not defined by these conventions.
        examples: ["2.0.0", "a01dbef8a"]

      - id: id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          Unique identifier of agent instance.
        examples: ["627cc493-f310-47de-96bd-71410b7dec09"]
        note: >
          If a deterministic source for an id is not available it is recommended to use
          a UUID v7 value.
