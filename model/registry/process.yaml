    attributes:
      - id: pid

        brief: >
          Virtual process identifier.
        note: >
          The process ID within a PID namespace. This is not necessarily unique
          across all processes on the host but it is unique within the process
          namespace that the process exists within.

      - id: session_leader.pid
        type: int
        brief: >
          The PID of the process's session leader. This is also the session ID
          (SID) of the process.
        examples: [14]
      - id: group_leader.pid
        type: int
        brief: >
          The PID of the process's group leader. This is also the process group
          ID (PGID) of the process.

      - id: executable.name
        type: string
        brief: >
          The name of the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set
          to the `Name` in `proc/[pid]/status`. On Windows, can be set to the
          base name of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.
        examples: ['otelcol']
      - id: executable.path
        type: string
        brief: >
          The full path to the process executable. On Linux based systems, can
          be set to the target of `proc/[pid]/exe`. On Windows, can be set to the
          result of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.
        examples: ['/usr/bin/cmd/otelcol']
      - id: command
        type: string
        brief: >
          The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux
          based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`.
          On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`.
        examples: ['cmd/otelcol']
      - id: command_line
        type: string
        brief: >
          The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing
          the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`.
          Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use
          `process.command_args` instead.
        examples: ['C:\cmd\otecol --config="my directory\config.yaml"']
      - id: command_args
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as
          received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid
          systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of
          null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based
          executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`.
        examples: ['cmd/otecol', '--config=config.yaml']
      - id: env_vars
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          Array of environment variable bindings.
        note: >
          As environment variables may change during a process's lifespan, this should be
          captured as a snapshot when the event occurred.

          May be filtered to protect sensitive information.

        type: string
