    brief: >
      The operating system (OS) on which the process represented by this resource is running.


      In OpenTelemetry the OS namespace is used to describe the operating system of the host which is emitting the telemetry signals.


      It is not used for the following scenarios:

      - Describing the OS of the machine which is hosting the virtualised host when the telemetry relates to the virtualised host.
        E.g. when an application is running in a VM on a Windows host, the OS entity should describe the OS of the VM, not the Windows host.

      - Describing the application runtime environment (e.g. JVM, WASM, etc.) as these machines are not classifed as host.
        E.g. when an application is running in a JVM on a Linux host, the OS entity should describe the Linux host, not the JVM.
        The process.runtime entity can be used to describe the JVM instead.

          `build_id` values SHOULD be obtained from the following sources:


          | OS | Primary | Fallback |

          | ------- | ------- | ------- |

          | Windows | `CurrentBuildNumber` from registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion` | - |

          | MacOS | `ProductBuildVersion` from `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist` | `ProductBuildVersion` from `/System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist` |

          | Linux | `BUILD_ID` from `/etc/os-release` | `BUILD_ID` from `/usr/lib/os-release`; <br> contents of `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`|
