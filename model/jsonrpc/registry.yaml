    attributes:
      - id: jsonrpc.request.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A string representation of the `id` property of the request and its
          corresponding response.
        examples: ['10', 'request-7']
        note: >
          The `id` property may be a string, number, null, or omitted entirely.
          When omitted, the request is treated as a notification.
          Using `null` is not equivalent to omitting the `id`, but it is
          [discouraged](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#id1).

          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT capture this attribute when the `id` is
          `null` or omitted.
      - id: jsonrpc.protocol.version
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Protocol version, as specified in the `jsonrpc` property of the
          request and its corresponding response.
        examples: ['2.0', '1.0']
