          A guid or another name describing the event source.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry defines the `source_id` in the [Loggegator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
          supposed to contain the component name, e.g. "gorouter", for
          CloudFoundry components.

          When system components are instrumented, values from the
          [Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
          should be used. The `system.id` should be set to
          `spec.deployment/spec.name`.
        examples:
          - 'cf/gorouter'
      - id: cloudfoundry.system.instance.id

          CloudFoundry defines the `instance_id` in the [Loggegator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
          supposed to contain the vm id for CloudFoundry components.

          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment

        brief: >
          The type of the event source.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry generates log messages with different source types for an
          applications. This indicates, whether the log was created from the
          actual application, a background task, the central load balancer, or
          the CloudFoundry runtime, e.g. during a deployment.

          The `source_type` is contained as a tag of the [Loggegator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is also available in the syslog drain structured data as documented
          in the [CloudFoundry Dev Guide](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).
          Application developers can access the value of the `source_type` in
          the log stream generated by `cf logs <app-name>`, usually in square
          brackets.
        examples:
          - 'APP/PROC/WEB/0'
          - 'APP/TASK/jobscheduler-task-70013817-ab92-4f75-82d4-de8ae4dd64b4'
          - 'RTR'
          - 'STG'
      - id: cloudfoundry.process.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The UID identifying the process.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.process_id`. It is supposed to be equal to
          `VCAP_APPLICATION.app_id` for applications deployed to the runtime.
          For system components, this could be the actual PID.
        examples: ['218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d']
      - id: cloudfoundry.process.type
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The type of process.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry applications can consist of multiple jobs. Usually the
          main process will be of type `web`. There can be additional background
          tasks or side-cars with different process types.
        examples: ['web']
