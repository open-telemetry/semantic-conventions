      - id: cloudfoundry.system.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A guid or another name describing the event source.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry defines the `source_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
          supposed to contain the component name, e.g. "gorouter", for
          CloudFoundry components.

          When system components are instrumented, values from the
          [Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
          should be used. The `system.id` should be set to
          `spec.deployment/spec.name`.
        examples:
          - 'cf/gorouter'
      - id: cloudfoundry.system.instance.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A guid describing the concrete instance of the event source.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry defines the `instance_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
          supposed to contain the vm id for CloudFoundry components.

          When system components are instrumented, values from the
          [Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
          should be used. The `system.instance.id` should be set to `spec.id`.
        examples:
          - '218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d'
      - id: cloudfoundry.app.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The name of the application.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.application_name`. This is the same value
          as reported by `cf apps`.
        examples: ['my-app-name']
      - id: cloudfoundry.app.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The guid of the application.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.application_id`. This is the same value as
          reported by `cf app <app-name> --guid`.
        examples: ['218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d']
      - id: cloudfoundry.app.instance.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The index of the application instance. 0 when just one instance is active.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry defines the `instance_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
          It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
          supposed to contain the application instance index for applications
          deployed on the runtime.

          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `CF_INSTANCE_INDEX`.
        examples:
          - '0'
          - '1'
      - id: cloudfoundry.space.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The name of the CloudFoundry space the application is running in.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.space_name`. This is the same value as
          reported by `cf spaces`.
        examples: ['my-space-name']
      - id: cloudfoundry.space.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The guid of the CloudFoundry space the application is running in.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.space_id`. This is the same value as
          reported by `cf space <space-name> --guid`.
        examples: ['218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d']
      - id: cloudfoundry.org.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The name of the CloudFoundry organization the app is running in.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.org_name`. This is the same value as
          reported by `cf orgs`.
        examples: ['my-org-name']
      - id: cloudfoundry.org.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The guid of the CloudFoundry org the application is running in.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.org_id`. This is the same value as

        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The UID identifying the process.
        note: |
          Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
          variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.process_id`. It is supposed to be equal to
          `VCAP_APPLICATION.app_id` for applications deployed to the runtime.
          For system components, this could be the actual PID.
        examples: ['218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d']
      - id: cloudfoundry.process.type
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The type of process.
        note: |
          CloudFoundry applications can consist of multiple jobs. Usually the
          main process will be of type `web`. There can be additional background
          tasks or side-cars with different process types.
        examples: ['web']
