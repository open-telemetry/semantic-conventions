          Identifies the class / type of event.
        note: >
          This attribute SHOULD be used by non-OTLP exporters
          when destination does not support `EventName` or equivalent property.
          This attribute MAY be used by applications using existing logging
          libraries that does not support `EventName` or equivalent property
          so that it can be used to set the `EventName` field by Collector or SDK components.
        examples: ["browser.mouse.click", "device.app.lifecycle"]
