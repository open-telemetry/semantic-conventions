          Identifies the class / type of event.
        note: >
          This attribute is used by non-OTLP exporters (e.g., console/stdout exporter) to emit the EventName 
          and by applications using existing logging libraries to add event name information that can be 
          processed by SDK or Collector components to set the EventName on log records.
