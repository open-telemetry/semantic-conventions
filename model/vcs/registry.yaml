          of the repository providing the complete HTTP(S) address in order to
          locate and identify the repository through a browser.
        note: |
          In Git Version Control Systems, the canonical URL SHOULD NOT include
          the `.git` extension.
        examples:
          [
            "https://github.com/opentelemetry/open-telemetry-collector-contrib",
            "https://gitlab.com/my-org/my-project/my-projects-project/repo",

          The human readable name of the repository. It SHOULD NOT include any
          additional identifier like Group/SubGroup in GitLab or organization
          in GitHub.
        note: |
          Due to it only being the name, it can clash with forks of the same
          repository if collecting telemetry across multiple orgs or groups in
          the same backends.
        examples:

          `base` refers to the starting point of a change. For example, `main`

          commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
          not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
          number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
          which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
          it is identical to the `ref.base.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
          It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
