      For successful processing, `error.type` must be empty. For failed processing, `error.type` must contain the failure cause.
      For the SDK Simple and Batching Span Processor a span is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter, not when the corresponding export call has finished.

          A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue.

      For successful exports, `error.type` must be empty. For failed exports, `error.type` must contain the failure cause.
      For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_spans`), rejected spans must count as failed and only non-rejected spans count as success.
      If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.
