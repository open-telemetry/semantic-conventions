        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The base score of the vulnerability.
        note: >
          Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe. Base scores cover an assessment
          for exploitability metrics (attack vector, complexity, privileges, and user interaction),
          impact metrics (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and scope. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

          The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides qualitative severity rankings of "Low", "Medium",
          and "High" for CVSS v2.0 base score ranges in addition to the severity ratings for CVSS v3.0 as they are
          defined in the CVSS v3.0 specification.

        note: >
          Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe. Environmental scores cover an assessment
          for any modified base metrics, confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements. For example, [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
