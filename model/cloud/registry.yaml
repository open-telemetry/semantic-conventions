        brief: >
          The geographical region within a cloud provider. When associated with
          a resource, this attribute specifies the region where the resource operates.
          When calling services or APIs deployed on a cloud, this attribute identifies the region where the called destination is deployed.
        note: >
          Refer to your provider's docs to see the available regions, for example
          [Alibaba Cloud regions](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm),
          [AWS regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/),
          [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/),
          [Google Cloud regions](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations),
          or [Tencent Cloud regions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/213/6091).
        examples: ['us-central1', 'us-east-1']
      - id: cloud.resource_id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource
          (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS,
          a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure,
          a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
        note: |
          On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

          The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
          The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
            Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
            [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
            with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
            multiple different aliases.
          - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
            *not* the function app, having the form
            `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider.
        examples:
          - 'arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function'
          - '//run.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/services/SERVICE_ID'
          - '/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>'
      - id: cloud.availability_zone
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Cloud regions often have multiple, isolated locations known as zones
          to increase availability. Availability zone represents the
          zone where the resource is running.
        note: >
          Availability zones are called "zones" on Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud.
        examples: ['us-east-1c']
