    brief: >
      A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).

      A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Any OpenTelemetry signal associated with a worker
      should be associated to the worker that performed the corresponding work.

      For example, when a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference the different `cicd.worker` resources
      corresponding to the workers that executed each task run.
      The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.
