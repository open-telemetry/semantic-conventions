    brief: >
      A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).

      A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Each span representing a pipeline run or a task run
      should be linked to the worker that performed the corresponding work.

      When a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference different `cicd.worker` resources.
      The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.
