    brief: >
      This group describes attributes specific to pipelines within a Continuous
      Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system. A
      [pipeline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in this
      case is a series of steps that are performed in order to deliver a new
      version of software. This aligns with the
      [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pipeline) definition
      of a pipeline where a **pipeline** is the system for developing and
      producing something. In the context of CI/CD, a pipeline produces or
      delivers software.
