    note: |
      There might be errors in a pipeline run that are non fatal (eg. they are suppressed) or in a parallel stage multiple stages could have a fatal error.
      This means that this error count might not be the same as the count of metric `cicd.pipeline.run.duration` with run result `failure`.
