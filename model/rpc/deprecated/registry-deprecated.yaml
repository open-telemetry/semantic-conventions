        note: >
          This is the logical name of the service from the RPC interface perspective,
          which can be different from the name of any implementing class.
          The `code.namespace` attribute may be used to store the latter
          (despite the attribute name, it may include a class name;
          e.g., class with method actually executing the call on the server side,
          RPC client stub class on the client side).
        examples: "myservice.EchoService"
