          RPC server [host name](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_naming.html).
        note: >
          May contain server IP address, DNS name, or local socket name. When host component is an IP address,
          instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set
          `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: if `server.address` is set and if the port is

        note: |
          If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

          If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
          for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
          `error.type`.
