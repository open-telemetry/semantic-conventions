    brief: This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
    note: |
      RPC client spans SHOULD cover the entire client-side lifecycle of an RPC,
      starting when the RPC is initiated and ending when the response is received
      or the RPC is terminated due to an error or cancellation.

      For streaming RPCs, the span covers the full lifetime of the request and/or
      response streams until they are closed or terminated.

      If a transient issue happened and was retried within this RPC, the corresponding
      span SHOULD cover the duration of the logical call with all retries.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status** Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
      document for details on how to record span status.
