        brief: Status code of the RPC returned by the RPC server or generated by the client
        note: >
          Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success,
          warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.

          Semantic conventions for individual RPC frameworks SHOULD document what
          `rpc.response.status_code` means in the context of that system and which values
          are considered to represent errors.
        examples: ["OK", "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED", "-32602"]

        brief: >
          RPC request metadata, `<key>` being the normalized RPC metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values.
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
          Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
          `rpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`
        examples: [["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]]

          `id` property of request or response.
          Since protocol allows id to be int, string, `null` or missing (for notifications),
          value is expected to be cast to string for simplicity.
          Use empty string in case of `null` value. Omit entirely if this is a notification.
        examples: ['10', 'request-7', '']
