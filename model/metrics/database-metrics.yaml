        note: >
          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable.
          Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.

          If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.
