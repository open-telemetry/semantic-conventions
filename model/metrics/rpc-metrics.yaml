  # RPC Server metrics
  - id: metric.rpc.server.duration
    type: metric
    metric_name: rpc.server.duration
    brief: Measures the duration of inbound RPC.
    instrument: histogram
    unit: "ms"
    note: |
      While streaming RPCs may record this metric as start-of-batch
      to end-of-batch, it's hard to interpret in practice.

      **Streaming**: N/A.

  - id: metric.rpc.server.request.size
    type: metric
    metric_name: rpc.server.request.size
    brief: Measures the size of RPC request messages (uncompressed).
    instrument: histogram
    unit: "By"
    note: |
      **Streaming**: Recorded per message in a streaming batch

  - id: metric.rpc.server.response.size
    type: metric
    metric_name: rpc.server.response.size
    brief: Measures the size of RPC response messages (uncompressed).

      **Streaming**: Recorded per response in a streaming batch

  - id: metric.rpc.server.requests_per_rpc

    note: |
      Should be 1 for all non-streaming RPCs.

      **Streaming** : This metric is required for server and client streaming RPCs
