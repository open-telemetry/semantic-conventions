          If an HTTP client request is explicitly made to an IP address, e.g. `http://x.x.x.x:8080`, then
          `server.address` SHOULD be the IP address `x.x.x.x`. A DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used.

        note: >
          HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 requests share connections in the connection pool and are both reported as version `1.1`.
          So, the `network.protocol.version` value reported on connection metrics is different than the one reported
          on request-level metrics or spans for HTTP 1.0 requests.
        examples: ["1.1", "2", "3"]

          If the HTTP request method isn't known, it sets the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.
          It's not possible at the moment to override the list of known HTTP methods.
