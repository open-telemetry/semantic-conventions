          Determined by using the first of the following that applies

          - The [primary server name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) of the matched virtual host. MUST only
            include host identifier.
          - Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
            if it's sent in absolute-form.
          - Host identifier of the `Host` header

          SHOULD NOT be set if only IP address is available and capturing name would require a reverse DNS lookup.

          Warning: since this attribute may be based on the `Host` header, opting in to it may allow an attacker
          to trigger cardinality limits, degrading the usefulness of the metric.

        requirement_level: opt_in
        brief: >
          Port of the local HTTP server that received the request.
