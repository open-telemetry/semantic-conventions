          If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type or a component-specific low cardinality error code.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error code.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.
