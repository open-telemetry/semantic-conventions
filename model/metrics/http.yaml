            include host identifier.
          - Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
            if it's sent in absolute-form.
          - Host identifier of the `Host` header

          SHOULD NOT be set if only IP address is available and capturing name would require a reverse DNS lookup.

        note: |
          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the canonical [Reason Phrase](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.html#section-6.1.1)
          corresponding to the returned status code or to `_OTHER`.

          If request fails with an error before or after status code was sent or received, such error SHOULD be
          recorded on `error.type` attribute. The description SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.
