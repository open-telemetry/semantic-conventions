    note: >
      `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a
      [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset).
      This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change
      is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the
      values of `hw.status` over time.
