      - id: mcp.input.param
        type: template[any]
        brief: Parameters passed to the request within `params` object.
          `<key>` being the normalized parameter key (lowercase), the value being the parameter value.
        note: |
          Instrumentations MAY support capturing input parameters passed
          to the request or notification within `params` object.

          Instrumentations that support it SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which keys
          are to be captured. Including all request or notifications parameters
          can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          Value type SHOULD match the value of the parameter as passed in the request
          or notification.

          Instrumentation SHOULD allow capturing parameters passed with MCP's
          reserved `_meta` key.

          Examples:

          In a params object with the following structure:

          ```json
          {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 12345,
            "method": "some/method",
            "params": {
              "location": "Seattle, WA",
              "a": 42,
              "complex": {"foo": "bar"}
              "_meta" : {
                "mcp.dev/baz": "qux"
              }
            }
          }
          ```

          - A `param.location` key with string value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.input.param.location` attribute with string value `"Seattle, WA"`.
          - A `param.a` key with integer value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.input.param.a`
            attribute with integer (signed 64 bit) value `42`.
          - A `param.complex` key with complex value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.input.param.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.
          - A `param._meta.mcp.dev/baz` key with string value `"qux"` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.input.param._meta.mcp.dev/baz` attribute with string value `"qux"`.

          The attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
          and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
          by the OpenTelemetry implementation.

          Keys SHOULD be captured as they appear in the request or notification
          without any additional normalization.

      - id: mcp.output.result
        type: template[any]
        brief: Result property returned in the response.
          `<key>` being the normalized result key (lowercase), the value being the result value.
        note: |
          Instrumentations MAY support capturing properties returned
          to the response within `result` object.

          Instrumentations that support it SHOULD require an explicit configuration
          to capture this attribute, as response result can contain sensitive information.

          Value type SHOULD match the value of the `result` object property as returned in the response.

          Instrumentation SHOULD allow capturing result properties passed with MCP's
          reserved `_meta` key.

          Examples:

          In a response with the following structure:

          ```json
          {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 12345,
            "result": {
              "location": "Seattle, WA",
              "a": 42,
              "complex": {"foo": "bar"},
              "_meta" : {
                "mcp.dev/baz": "qux"
              }
            }
          }
          ```

          - A `location` key with value `"Seattle, WA"` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.output.result.location` attribute with string value `"Seattle, WA"`.
          - A `a` key with value `42` SHOULD be recorded as the `mcp.output.result.a`
            attribute with integer (signed 64 bit) value `42`.
          - A `complex` key with value `{"foo": "bar"}` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.output.result.complex` attribute with complex value type `{"foo": "bar"}`.
          - A `_meta.mcp.dev/baz` key with string value `"qux"` SHOULD be recorded as the
            `mcp.output.result._meta.mcp.dev/baz` attribute with string value `"qux"`.

          The attribute value SHOULD be recorded in structured form when it's possible
          and MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not yet supported
          by the OpenTelemetry implementation.

          Keys SHOULD be captured as they appear in the result without any
          additional normalization.
