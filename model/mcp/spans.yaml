  - id: span.mcp.client
    type: span
    span_kind: client
    brief: This span describes the MCP call from the client side.
    note: |
      It's reported by the MCP client when it initiates the request
      or notification or by the MCP server when server initiates the operation.
      It covers the time to receive the response or ack from the peer.

      **Span name** SHOULD follow the format `{mcp.method.name} {target}`
      where target SHOULD match `{mcp.tool.name}` or `{mcp.prompt.name}` when
      applicable.
      If there is no low-cardinality `target` available, the Span name SHOULD be `{mcp.method.name}`.

      Instrumentation MAY allow users to opt into including `{mcp.resource.uri}`
      as `target` in the span name when it is available but SHOULD NOT include it by default
      to avoid high cardinality span names.

      **Span status** SHOULD be set to `ERROR` when `error.type` attribute is present.
      The status description SHOULD match the `JSONRPCError.message` if the message is available.

      Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document
      for more details.
