        brief: Peer address of the database node where the operation was performed.
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If applicable for this database system.
        note: >
          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable.
          Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.

          If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.
      - ref: network.peer.port
        requirement_level:
          recommended: if and only if `network.peer.address` is set.
      - ref: server.address

          Name of the database host.
      - ref: server.port
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.
