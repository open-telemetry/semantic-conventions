    attributes:
      - ref: db.namespace
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If available.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            If readily available. Otherwise, if the instrumentation library parses `db.query.text` to capture
            `db.operation.name`, then it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.
      - ref: server.address
        brief: >
          Name of the database host.
      - ref: server.port
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.
      - ref: error.type
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: >
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the database or the client library,
          the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

  - id: attributes.db.client.all_common
    type: attribute_group
    brief: This group documents attributes that describe database call along with network information.
    extends: attributes.db.client.minimal
    attributes:
      - ref: db.collection.name
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            If readily available. Otherwise, if the instrumentation library parses `db.query.text` to capture
            `db.collection.name`, then it SHOULD be the first collection name found in the query.
      - ref: db.system
        # TODO: Not adding to the minimal because of https://github.com/open-telemetry/build-tools/issues/192
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: db.instance.id
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If different from the `server.address`
      - ref: network.peer.address
        brief: Peer address of the database node where the operation was performed.
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If applicable for this database system.
        note: >
          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable.
          Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.

          If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.
      - ref: network.peer.port
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If and only if `network.peer.address` is set.
