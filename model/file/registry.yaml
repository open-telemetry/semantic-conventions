    brief: "Describes file attributes."
    attributes:
      - id: file.accessed
        type: string
        brief: >
          Time when the file was last accessed, in ISO 8601 format.
        note: >
          This attribute might not be supported by some file systems — NFS, FAT32, in embedded OS, etc.

      - id: file.attributes
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          Array of file attributes.
        note: >
          Attributes names depend on the OS or file system. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of values expected for this
          attribute: `archive`, `compressed`, `directory`, `encrypted`, `execute`, `hidden`, `immutable`, `journaled`, `read`, `readonly`, `symbolic link`, `system`, `temporary`, `write`.

        type: string
        brief: >
          Time when the file attributes or metadata was last changed, in ISO 8601 format.
        note: >
          `file.changed` captures the time when any of the file's properties or attributes
          (including the content) are changed, while `file.modified` captures the timestamp
          when the file content is modified.

      - id: file.directory

          File extension, excluding the leading dot.
        stability: development
        examples: ['png', 'gz']
        note: >
          When the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should
          be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
      - id: file.fork_name
        type: string
        brief: >
          Name of the fork. A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
        note: >
          On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at
          least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.

          On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is
          just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet.
          An ADS is typically of the form: C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name, and some_fork_name is the
          value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension`
          should populate `file.extension`. The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.
