          'event.data' in the case of mobile crashes will be an attribute that contains nested attributes.
          Android crashes will contain 'stacktrace', 'thread', and 'throwableMessage'
          On the iOS side, it will contain 'crashReport' containing the contents from PLCrashReporter
        examples: ['stacktrace: stacktraceValue, thread: threadValue, throwableMessage: throwableMessageValue',
                   'crashReport: crashReportContents']
