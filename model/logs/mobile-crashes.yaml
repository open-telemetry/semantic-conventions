          The contents from PLCrashReporter
          Contains three primary elements. "images", "threads" and "signal". These could be broken out as individual elements
          Given that crash reports are only sent on the subsequent execution of the app, both the customer app or the phone os may have been upgraded.   
          As such both the original app version and os version should be sent.
          "appMinorVersionAtCrash" - minor version of customer app at crash
          "appMajorVersionAtCrash" - major version of customer app at crash
          "osVersionAtCrash" - version of iOS at crash
          For ios crashes
        type: string
        examples: ['*Contents of PL CrashReporter crash report*']
