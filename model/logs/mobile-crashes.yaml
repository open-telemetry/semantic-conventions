      This document defines attributes for crashes represented using Log Record Events.
    attributes:

        type: string
        requirement_level: required
        brief: >
          Will be the string "crash" to denote that this is a crash event
        examples: ['crash']
      - id: domain
        type: string
        requirement_level: required
        brief: >
          Will be the string "mobile" to denote that this is a crash event from a mobile device
        examples: ['mobile']
        note: |
          Events across different domains may have same `event.name`, yet be
          unrelated events.

          Will be different in Android vs iOS. 
          Android will contain 'stacktrace', 'thread', and 'throwableMessage'
          iOS will contain 'crashReport' containing the contents from PLCrashReporter
          Both will have an 'isAppInForeground' field
        examples: ['stacktrace: stacktraceValue, thread: threadValue, throwableMessage: throwableMessageValue, isAppInForeground: false',
                   'crashReport: crashReportContents, isAppInForeground: true']
