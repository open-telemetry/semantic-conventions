        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client
          or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

          Extension: A tool executed on the agent-side to directly call external APIs, bridging the gap between the agent and real-world systems.
            Agent-side operations involve actions that are performed by the agent on the server or within the agent's controlled environment.
          Function: A tool executed on the client-side, where the agent generates parameters for a predefined function, and the client executes the logic.
            Client-side operations are actions taken on the user's end or within the client application.
          Datastore: A tool used by the agent to access and query structured or unstructured external data for retrieval-augmented tasks or knowledge updates.

        brief: The data source identifier.
        note: >
          Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data.
          A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application.
          The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or
          object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

          If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic
          conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation.
          If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

        # we might need to record requested and actual output types on the same span/event
        # at some point. In this case, we might need to add a new attribute.
        # we may also need to record an array of types if multiple are requested/returned.
        brief: Represents the content type requested by the client.
        note: >
          This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a
          specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.

          This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.
