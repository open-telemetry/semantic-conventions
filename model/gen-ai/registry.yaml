        brief: The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
          by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

          The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
          Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
          libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
          instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
          attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

          For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
          If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.
        examples: 'openai'
      - id: gen_ai.request.model

          If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic

          If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

        brief: Represents the content type requested by the client.
        note: >
          This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a
          specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.

          This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.
