        brief: The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
          by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

          The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
          For example, when using OpenAI client libraries to communicate with Mistral, the `gen_ai.system`
          is set to `openai` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

          For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
          If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.
        examples: 'openai'
      - id: gen_ai.request.model

        note: >
          If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic
          conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation.
          If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.
