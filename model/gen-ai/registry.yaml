        brief: The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
          by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

          The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
          Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
          libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
          instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
          attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

          For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
          If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.
        examples: 'openai'
      - id: gen_ai.request.model

              brief: 'A coordinator for multiple agents, the subordinate agents follow the instructions of the coordinator'
              stability: development
        brief: Roles based on job responsibilities
        note: >
          Agent roles are classified based on job responsibilities. Worker agents perform specific tasks
          such as “Researcher” or “Writer” within a team, leveraging their skills for assigned duties.
          Coordinator agents manage multiple worker agents, ensuring task execution and providing instructions.
          Users can create custom roles or modify existing ones to fit their needs. Worker agents function
          independently on designated tasks, while coordinator oversee and direct them for efficient collaboration.
          This hierarchical structure allows for scalable and organized agent operations, enabling automation and
          improved workflow management in various domains.

          Extension: A tool executed on the agent-side to directly call external APIs, bridging the gap between the agent and real-world systems.
            Agent-side operations involve actions that are performed by the agent on the server or within the agent's controlled environment.
          Function: A tool executed on the client-side, where the agent generates parameters for a predefined function, and the client executes the logic.
            Client-side operations are actions taken on the user's end or within the client application.
          Datastore: A tool used by the agent to access and query structured or unstructured external data for retrieval-augmented tasks or knowledge updates.

        note: >
          If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic
          conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation.
          If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

        # we might need to record requested and actual output types on the same span/event
        # at some point. In this case, we might need to add a new attribute.
        # we may also need to record an array of types if multiple are requested/returned.
        brief: Represents the content type requested by the client.
        note: >
          This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a
          specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.

          This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.
