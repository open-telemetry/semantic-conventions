        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client
          or server instrumentation.
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

        brief: The number of tokens used in the GenAI input (prompt).
        note: |
          This value SHOULD include all types of input tokens, including cached tokens.
          Instrumentations SHOULD make a best effort to populate this value, using a total
          provided by the provider when available or, depending on the provider API,
          by summing different token types parsed from the provider output.

          > [!WARNING]
          > This attribute may contain sensitive information.

          It's expected to be an object - in case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an object. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.
        examples:
          - |
              {
                  "location": "San Francisco?",
                  "date": "2025-10-01"

        brief: The list of source system tool definitions available to the GenAI agent or model.
        note: |
          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

        note: |
          This attribute links the telemetry to an external security event record
          in systems such as SIEM, incident management, or security dashboards.

          The value typically comes from the response of an external security
          inspection service or may be included in response headers when inspection
          happens alongside the LLM call.

          Use this when correlation with external security systems is required

          Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data.
          A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application.
          The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or
          object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

        stability: development
        type: any
        brief: Messages returned by the model where each message represents
          a specific model response (choice, candidate).
        note: |
          Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)

          Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by
          the model. Each message corresponds to exactly one generation
          (choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
          multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

          When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
          form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
          output messages.

          > [!Warning]
          > This attribute is likely to contain sensitive information including user/PII data.

        note: >
          This attribute provides a human-readable interpretation of the evaluation score produced by an evaluator.
          For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator.
          The label SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.
