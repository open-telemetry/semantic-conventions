    attributes:
      - ref: gen_ai.output.type
        note: >
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the output type requested by the client:
          - `json` for structured outputs with defined or undefined schema
          - `image` for image output
          - `speech` for speech output
          - `text` for plain text output

          The attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.
