        brief: >
          The [`service.name`](/docs/resource/README.md#service)
          of the remote service. SHOULD be equal to the actual `service.name`
          resource attribute of the remote service if any.
        examples: "AuthTokenCache"
        note: >
          It MUST be possible to configure the peer service name in declarative configuration as follows:

          - `peer` is host, and optionally the and path of the remote service that is used to identify the service
             instance, e.g., `example.com:443`, `1.2.3.4:8080`, `example.com`, `example.com:443/fooService`.
          - `service` is the name of the remote service, e.g., `AuthService` that will be translated to the
            `peer.service` attribute.


          ```yaml

          instrumentation/development:
            general:
              peer:
                service_mapping:
                  - peer: 1.2.3.4
                    service: FooService
                  - peer: 2.3.4.5
                    service: BarService
          ```
