      Semantic convention for attributes that describe the publish messaging destination on broker.
      The term Publish Destination refers to the destination the message was originally published to.
      These attributes should be used on the consumer side when information about
      the publish destination is available and different than the destination message are consumed from.
    note: |
      Publish destination attributes should be set on publish, receive,
      or other spans describing messaging operations.
      Destination attributes should be set when the messaging operation handles
      single messages. When the operation handles a batch of messages,
      the destination attributes should only be applied when the attribute value
      applies to all messages in the batch.
      In other cases, destination attributes may be set on links.
