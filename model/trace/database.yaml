          When connecting to a default instance, `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the name of

          In **CouchDB**, `db.operation.name` should be set to the HTTP method +
          the target REST route according to the API reference documentation.
          For example, when retrieving a document, `db.operation.name` would be set to
          (literally, i.e., without replacing the placeholders with concrete values):
          [`GET /{db}/{docid}`](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/document/common.html#get--db-docid).

          The index of the database being accessed as used in the [`SELECT` command](https://redis.io/commands/select).
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if it can be captured reliably.
        note: >
          The database index for current connection can be changed by the application dynamically. Instrumentations MAY use
          the initial database index provided in the connection string and keep track of the currently selected
          database to capture the `db.namespace`.

          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set this attribute if capturing it would require additional network calls to Redis.

          For commands that switch the database, this SHOULD be set to the target database (even if the command fails).
        examples: ["0", "1", "15"]

        note: >
          For **Redis**, the value provided for `db.query.text` SHOULD correspond to the syntax of the Redis CLI.
          If, for example, the [`HMSET` command](https://redis.io/commands/hmset) is invoked, `"HMSET myhash field1 'Hello' field2 'World'"` would be a suitable value for `db.query.text`.

        tag: tech-specific
      - ref: db.namespace
        note: |
          If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated
          (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most
          specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without
          the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.

          Unless specified by the system-specific semantic convention, the `db.namespace` attribute matches
          the name of the database being accessed.

          The database name can usually be obtained with database driver API such as
          [JDBC `Connection.getCatalog()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#getCatalog--)
          or [.NET `SqlConnection.Database`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.database).

          Some database drivers don't detect when the current database is changed (for example, with SQL `USE database` statement).
          Instrumentations that parse SQL statements MAY use the database name provided
          in the connection string and keep track of the currently selected database name.

          For commands that switch the database, this SHOULD be set to the target database (even if the command fails).

          If instrumentation cannot reliably determine the current database name, it SHOULD NOT set `db.namespace`.
