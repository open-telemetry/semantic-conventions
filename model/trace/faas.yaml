        This semantic convention describes an instance of a function that
        runs without provisioning or managing of servers (also known as
        serverless functions or Function as a Service (FaaS)) with spans.

      - ref: faas.trigger
        note: |
          For the server/consumer span on the incoming side,
          `faas.trigger` MUST be set.

          Clients invoking FaaS instances usually cannot set `faas.trigger`,
          since they would typically need to look in the payload to determine
          the event type. If clients set it, it should be the same as the
          trigger that corresponding incoming would have (i.e., this has
          nothing to do with the underlying transport used to make the API
          call to invoke the lambda, which is often HTTP).

            For some cloud providers, like AWS or GCP, the region in which a
            function is hosted is essential to uniquely identify the function
            and also part of its endpoint. Since it's part of the endpoint
            being called, the region is always known to clients. In these cases,
            `faas.invoked_region` MUST be set accordingly. If the region is
            unknown to the client or not required for identifying the invoked
            function, setting `faas.invoked_region` is optional.
