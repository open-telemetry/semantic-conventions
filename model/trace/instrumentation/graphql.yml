    brief: >
      This document defines semantic conventions to apply when instrumenting the GraphQL implementation. They map
      GraphQL operations to attributes on a Span.
    attributes:
      - id: operation.name
        brief: "The name of the operation being executed."
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: 'findBookById'
      - id: operation.type
        brief: "The type of the operation being executed."
        stability: experimental
        type:
          allow_custom_values: false
          members:
            - id: query
              value: "query"
              brief: "GraphQL query"
            - id: mutation
              value: "mutation"
              brief: "GraphQL mutation"
            - id: subscription
              value: "subscription"
              brief: "GraphQL subscription"
        examples: ['query', 'mutation', 'subscription']
      - id: document
        brief: "The GraphQL document being executed."
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        note: The value may be sanitized to exclude sensitive information.
        examples: 'query findBookById { bookById(id: ?) { name } }'
