          Determined by using the first of the following that applies

          - Host identifier of the [request target](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource)
            if it's sent in absolute-form
          - Host identifier of the `Host` header

          If an HTTP client request is explicitly made to an IP address, e.g. `http://x.x.x.x:8080`, then
          `server.address` SHOULD be the IP address `x.x.x.x`. A DNS lookup SHOULD NOT be used.
