    brief: >
      This document defines deprecated attributes used to report an error.
    attributes:
      - id: error.message
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["Unexpected input type: string", "The user has exceeded their storage quota"]
        brief: A message providing more detail about an error in human-readable form.
        note: |
          `error.message` should provide additional context and detail about an error.
          It is NOT RECOMMENDED to duplicate the value of `error.type` in `error.message`.
          It is also NOT RECOMMENDED to duplicate the value of `exception.message` in `error.message`.

          `error.message` is NOT RECOMMENDED for metrics or spans due to its unbounded cardinality and overlap with span status.
        deprecated:
          reason: obsoleted
          note: Use domain-specific error message attribute. For example, use
            `feature_flag.error.message` for feature flag errors.
