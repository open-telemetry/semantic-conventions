        note: >
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code reported by the component, the canonical name of the error,
          or another low-cardinality error identifier. Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

      It is recommended to report `hw.energy` instead of `hw.power` when possible.

    note: >
      `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a
      [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset).
      This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change
      is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the
      values of `hw.status` over time.
