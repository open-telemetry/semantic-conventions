  - id: metric.hw.host.ambient_temperature
    type: metric
    metric_name: hw.host.ambient_temperature
    annotations:
      code_generation:
        metric_value_type: double
    stability: development
    brief: "Ambient (external) temperature of the physical host"
    instrument: gauge
    unit: "Cel"
    extends: hardware.attributes.common

  - id: metric.hw.host.energy
    type: metric
    metric_name: hw.host.energy
    annotations:
      code_generation:
        metric_value_type: double
    stability: development
    brief: "Total energy consumed by the entire physical host, in joules"
    instrument: counter
    unit: "J"
    extends: hardware.attributes.common
    note: >
      The overall energy usage of a host MUST be reported using the specific `hw.host.energy` and `hw.host.power`
      metrics **only**, instead of the generic `hw.energy` and `hw.power` described in the previous section, to prevent
      summing up overlapping values.

    type: metric
    metric_name: hw.host.heating_margin
    annotations:
      code_generation:
        metric_value_type: double
    stability: development
    brief: >
      By how many degrees Celsius the temperature of the physical host can be increased, before reaching a warning
      threshold on one of the internal sensors
    instrument: gauge
    unit: "Cel"

  - id: metric.hw.host.power
    type: metric
    metric_name: hw.host.power
    annotations:
      code_generation:
        metric_value_type: double
    stability: development
    brief: >
      Instantaneous power consumed by the entire physical host in Watts (`hw.host.energy` is preferred)
    instrument: gauge
    unit: "W"
    extends: hardware.attributes.common
