        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system`
          namespace.
        note: |
          K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
          added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
          official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
          `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
          rationale.

          Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
          `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
          for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
          namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
          change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
          UUIDs as standardized by
          [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
          Which states:

          > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
          > ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
          > different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
          > extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

          Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
          conflict.
