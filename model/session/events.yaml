      When the `session.start` event contains both `session.id` and `session.previous_id` fields,
      this indicates that the new session can be associated with the old session.

      - ref: session.id

            If the new session is being created as a continuation of a previous session.
        brief: The previous `session.id` for this user, when known.
        note: >
          The `session.id` and `session.previous_id` attributes MUST have different values within the scope of an event.


          If the session ID in `session.previous_id` has not yet ended via an explicit `session.end` event,
          then the consumer SHOULD treat this continuation event as semantically equivalent to `session.end(session.previous_id)` and `session.start(session.id)`.
