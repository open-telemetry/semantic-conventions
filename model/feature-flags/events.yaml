    brief: >
      Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.
    note: >
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag
      value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an
      application lifecycle.
      For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a
      flag each time a button is clicked.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

              Otherwise, `feature_flag.result.value` should be treated as opt-in.

        note: |
          If one of these values applies, then it MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

          | Value | Description | Stability |
          | --- | --- | --- |
          | `flag_not_found` | The flag could not be found. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `invalid_context` | The evaluation context does not meet provider requirements. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `parse_error` | An error was encountered parsing data, such as a flag configuration. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `provider_fatal` | The provider has entered an irrecoverable error state. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `provider_not_ready` | The value was resolved before the provider was initialized. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `targeting_key_missing` | The provider requires a targeting key and one was not provided in the evaluation context. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `type_mismatch` | The type of the flag value does not match the expected type. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
          | `general` | The error was for a reason not enumerated above. | ![Release Candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-rc-mediumorchid) |
      - ref: error.message
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If and only if an error occurred during flag evaluation and `error.type` does not sufficiently describe the error.
        note: >
          Should not simply duplicate the value of `error.type`, but should provide more context.
          For example, if `error.type` is `invalid_context` the `error.message` may enumerate which context keys are missing or invalid.
