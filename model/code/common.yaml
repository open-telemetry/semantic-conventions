    brief: >
      Often a signal ie Span/Event, is closely tied to a certain unit of code that is logically responsible for handling
      the operation that the signal is for.
      These attributes allow the unit of code to be reported and therefore to provide more context.
    note: >
      In the case of a span this would usually be the method that starts the span and
      for events/logs it is the method emitting the signal.

      For an HTTP server span, this would be the function that handles the incoming request, for example.
