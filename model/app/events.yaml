    brief: >
      This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.
    note: >
      The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has
      clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks
      outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event.
      This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and
      touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating
      this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch
      release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided
      in absolute screen pixels.

    brief: >
      This event indicates that the application has detected substandard UI
      rendering performance.
    note: >
      Jank happens when the UI is rendered slowly enough for the user to
      experience some disruption or sluggishness.

    type: event
    name: app.screen.visible
    brief: >
      This event captures the duration that a screen was visible to the user, indicating the time between when the screen becomes
      visible and when it stops being visible.
    note: >
      This event measures the screen's visibility, in seconds, meaning it includes only the time the screen is actively being shown to the user.
      It does not include times when the app is in the background or when other screens/modal views are covering it. For example:
      - **iOS**: From `viewDidAppear` to `viewWillDisappear`, indicating when the screen is first shown and when it's about to disappear.
      - **Android**: From `onResume` to `onPause`, indicating when the screen comes to the foreground and when it goes to the background.
