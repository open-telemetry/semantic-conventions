    brief: >
      This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.
    note: >
      The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has
      clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks
      outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event.
      This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and
      touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating
      this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch
      release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided
      in absolute screen pixels.
