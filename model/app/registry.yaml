        brief: >
          A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device
        note: |
          Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
          It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
          Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
          If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
          If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

          For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

          For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

          - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
          - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
          - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
          - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

          More information about Android identifier best practices can be found in the [Android user data IDs guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

        brief: >
          An identifier that uniquely differentiates this screen from other
          screens in the same application.
        note: >
          A screen represents only the part of the device display drawn by the app.
          It typically contains multiple widgets or UI components and
          is larger in scope than individual widgets. Multiple screens can
          coexist on the same display simultaneously (e.g., split view on tablets).

          The type of UI management component or framework used to render and manage the screen's
          presentation and interactions.
        note: >
          This attribute indicates which framework or structure is used to manage and display the
          screen’s content. For iOS, it may refer to either SwiftUI (declarative) or UIKit (imperative) for managing views.
          On Android, it can refer to either an Activity or a Fragment.

        brief: >
          The total time, in seconds, that the screen remained visible to the user.
        note: >
          This attribute measures the duration during which the screen is visible and actively being displayed to the user.
          It begins when the screen becomes visible (e.g., `viewDidAppear` on iOS or `onResume` on Android) and ends when it is no longer visible
          (e.g., `viewWillDisappear` on iOS or `onPause` on Android).
          It does **not** include the time when the screen is in the background, nor does it account for time the screen may be obscured by other views
          or overlays (e.g., modals, popups, or other screens in split-view).

        note: >
          This is the time, in seconds, between the user's initiation of the app start (e.g., tapping the app icon or opening a link) and the point when the app is fully ready for interaction,
          such as the main screen becoming visible or the app’s main functionality being accessible.
