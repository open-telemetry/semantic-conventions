    brief: This span represents an application launch operation.
    note: |
      **Span name:** MUST be `AppLaunch`.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      This span captures the time from user initiation (e.g., tapping the app icon or opening a link) 
      to the moment the app is ready for interaction.

    brief: This span describes the time until the first visual render of an application UI screen.
    note: |
      **Span name**: MUST be one of the following based on the measurement:
      - `TimeToFirstDraw`: Time from screen initialization to the first pixel drawn.
      - `TimeToFirstAppear`: Time from screen initialization to first appearance.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      This span captures the first visual render of the screen, even if it 
      might not be fully interactive or loaded yet.

    span_kind: client
    brief: This span describes an application screen load operation, from navigation trigger to when the main thread becomes ready for user input.
    note: |
      **Span name:** MUST be `ScreenLoad`.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      This span captures the time from user initiation of navigation (e.g., tapping a button) to the point when the main thread is 
      ready to handle user input (e.g., taps, scrolls, gestures). 
      **Main thread readiness** refers to when the UI thread is no longer blocked by rendering, animations, or background tasks, 
      and is free to accept user input. 

      It is important to note that while the main thread may be ready, some dynamic content, animations, or UI components may 
      still be loading, making the screen "appear" interactive even if it's not fully ready.

    brief: >
      This span captures the duration that a screen was visible to the user, indicating the time between when the screen becomes 
      visible and when it stops being visible.
    note: |
      **Span name:** MUST be `ScreenVisible`.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      This span captures the amount of time a screen remained visible to the user across platforms. For example:
      - **iOS**: From `viewDidAppear` to `viewWillDisappear`, indicating when the screen is first shown and when it's about to disappear.
      - **Android**: From `onResume` to `onPause`, indicating when the screen comes to the foreground and when it goes to the background.

      This span measures the screenâ€™s visibility, meaning it includes only the time the screen is actively being shown to the user. 
      It does not include times when the app is in the background or when other screens/modal views are covering it.
