    brief: >
      This span_kind captures the time that a screen was visible to the user, indicating the time between when the screen becomes
      visible and when it stops being visible.
    note: |
      **Span name:** MUST be `app.screen.time_on_screen`.

      **Span kind** MUST be `INTERNAL`.

      This span captures the screen's visibility, in seconds, meaning it includes only the time the screen is actively being shown to the user.
      It does not include times when the app is in the background or when other screens/modal views are covering it. For example:
      - **iOS**: From `viewDidAppear` to `viewWillDisappear`, indicating when the screen is first shown and when it's about to disappear.
      - **Android**: From `onResume` to `onPause`, indicating when the screen comes to the foreground and when it goes to the background.
