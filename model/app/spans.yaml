    brief: >
      This span describes the invocation of a function/method which could be triggered based on user input in a cli application or a user initiating it via the ui.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be set to {process.executable.name}.
      Instrumentations that have additional context about executed commands MAY use
      a different low-cardinality span name format and SHOULD document it.
