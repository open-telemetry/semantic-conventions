        note: |
          When connecting to a default instance, `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the name of

          `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the combination of instance and database name following the `{instance_name}.{database_name}` pattern.

          The current database may change during the lifetime of a connection, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the current database without causing an additional query to be executed
          (e.g. `SELECT DB_NAME()`), then it is RECOMMENDED to set `db.namespace` to the database name provided at connection time

          When `az.namespace` attribute is populated, it MUST be set to `Microsoft.DocumentDB` for all
          operations performed by Cosmos DB client.

        note: |
          The `db.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values.
          If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used.

          Batch operations:

          - `execute_batch`

          Bulk operations:

          - `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
            [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations)).
            which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
          - `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
            within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
            For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
            property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

          - `upsert_item`

          Permission operations:

          - `create_permission`
          - `delete_permission`

          - `read_all_users`
          - `read_user`

          - `read_all_user_defined_functions`

          If none of them applies, it's RECOMMENDED to use language-agnostic representation of
          client method name in snake_case. Instrumentations SHOULD document
          additional values when introducing new operations.
