          When connected to a default instance, `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the name of
          the database. When connected to a [named instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/connect/jdbc/building-the-connection-url#named-and-multiple-sql-server-instances),
          `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the combination of instance and database name following the `{instance_name}.{database_name}` pattern.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DB_NAME()`),

          (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most
          specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without
          the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.

          Unless specified by the system-specific semantic convention, the `db.namespace` attribute matches
          the name of the database being accessed.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DATABASE()`),
          then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
      - ref: db.response.status_code
        brief: >
          Database response code recorded as string.
        note: |
          SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
          return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
          See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
          for the details.

          Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
          error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
          For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
          class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

          Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
          the most specific code available to them.

          Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
          codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
          at all):

          - [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
          - [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/)
          - [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
          - [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
          - [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
          - [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

          These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
          known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
          it SHOULD be used.

          When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
          instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
          concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

          For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
          SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
          `db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

          The `db.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values.
          If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used.

          Batch operations:

          - `execute_batch`

          Bulk operations:

          - `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
            [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations)).
            which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
          - `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
            within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
            For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
            property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.
