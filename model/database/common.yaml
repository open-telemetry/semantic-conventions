            If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the
            database call. The operation name MAY be parsed from the query text,
            in which case it SHOULD be the single operation name found in the query.
      - ref: server.address
        brief: >
          Name of the database host.
      - ref: server.port
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set.
      - ref: db.response.status_code
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If the operation failed and status code is available.
      - ref: error.type
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: >
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library,
          or the canonical name of exception that occurred.

          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a
          generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

    brief: This group defines the attributes describing database operations that
      have query and collection name.
    attributes:
      - ref: db.query.text
      - ref: db.query.summary
        requirement_level:
          recommended: if readily available or if instrumentation supports query summarization.
      - ref: db.collection.name
        sampling_relevant: true
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.
            The collection name MAY be parsed from the query text,
            in which case it SHOULD be the single collection name in the query.
