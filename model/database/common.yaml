        requirement_level:

        note: >
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library,
          or the canonical name of exception that occurred.

          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a
          generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.
