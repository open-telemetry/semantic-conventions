            in which case it SHOULD be the first operation name found in the query.

          Name of the database host.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: >
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the database or the client library,
          the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.
