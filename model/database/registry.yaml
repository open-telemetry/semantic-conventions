    attributes:
      - id: db.collection.name
        type: string
        stability: release_candidate
        brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          unless the query format is known to only ever have a single collection name present.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
          then that collection name SHOULD be used.
        examples: ["public.users", "customers"]
      - id: db.namespace
        type: string
        stability: release_candidate
        brief: >
          The name of the database, fully qualified within the server address and port.
        note: >
          If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated
          (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most
          specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without
          the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
          means in the context of that system.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.
        examples: ["customers", "test.users"]
      - id: db.operation.name

        brief: >
          The name of the operation or command being executed.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          unless the query format is known to only ever have a single operation name present.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
          then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.
        examples: ["findAndModify", "HMSET", "SELECT"]
      - id: db.query.text
        type: string
        stability: release_candidate
        brief: >
          The database query being executed.
        note: >
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text
          then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated
          with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.

          Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query
          the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit
          to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.
        examples:
          [
            "SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = ?",
            'SET mykey ?',
          ]
      - id: db.operation.parameter

        brief: >
          A database operation parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name,
          and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        note: >
          If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          If `db.query.text` is also captured, then `db.operation.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.
        examples: ["someval", "55"]
      - id: db.query.summary

        brief: >
          Low cardinality representation of a database query text.
        note: >
          `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes
          a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key,
          especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query-text)
          section.
        examples:
          [
            'SELECT wuser_table',
            'INSERT shipping_details SELECT orders',
            'get user by id',

        brief: The number of queries included in a batch operation.
        note: >
          Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations,
          and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.
        examples: [2, 3, 4]
      - id: db.response.status_code
        type: string
        stability: release_candidate

        note: >
          The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code,
          but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate
          between various types of successful outcomes.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what
          `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.
