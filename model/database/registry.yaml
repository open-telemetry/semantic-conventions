    attributes:
      - id: db.collection.name
        type: string
        stability: experimental  # RELEASE CANDIDATE
        brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          A single database query may involve multiple collections.

          If the collection name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
          contain a single collection and it SHOULD match the value provided in
          the query text including any schema and database name prefix.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same collection name
          then that collection name SHOULD be used.

          If the operation or query involves multiple collections, `db.collection.name`
          SHOULD NOT be captured.

          This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.
        examples: ["public.users", "customers"]
      - id: db.namespace
        type: string
        stability: experimental  # RELEASE CANDIDATE
        brief: >
          The name of the database, fully qualified within the server address and port.
        note: >
          If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated
          (potentially using database system specific conventions) from most general to most
          specific namespace component, and more specific namespaces SHOULD NOT be captured without
          the more general namespaces, to ensure that "startswith" queries for the more general namespaces will be valid.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
          means in the context of that system.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

        stability: experimental  # RELEASE CANDIDATE
        brief: >
          The name of the operation or command being executed.
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          A single database query may involve multiple operations. If the operation
          name is parsed from the query text, it SHOULD only be captured for queries that
          contain a single operation or when the operation name describing the
          whole query is available by other means.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
          then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.

          This attribute has stability level RELEASE CANDIDATE.

        type: string

        brief: >
          The database query being executed.
        note: >
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text
          then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated
          with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.

          Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query
          the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit
          to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        brief: >
          A query parameter used in `db.query.text`, with `<key>` being the parameter name,
          and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        note: >
          Query parameters should only be captured when `db.query.text` is parameterized with placeholders.

          If a parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

        brief: >
          Low cardinality representation of a database query text.
        note: >
          `db.query.summary` provides static summary of the query text. It describes
          a class of database queries and is useful as a grouping key,
          especially when analyzing telemetry for database calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](../../docs/database/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-quey-text)
          section.

      - id: db.operation.batch.size

        stability: experimental  # RELEASE CANDIDATE
        brief: The number of queries included in a batch operation.
        note: >
          Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations,
          and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

        brief: Database response status code.
        note: >
          The status code returned by the database. Usually it represents an error code,
          but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate
          between various types of successful outcomes.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what
          `db.response.status_code` means in the context of that system.

      - id: db.system
        brief: The database management system (DBMS) product as identified by the client instrumentation.
        note: >
          The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client.
          For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system`
          is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

        brief: >
          A dynamic value in the url path.
        note: >
          Many Elasticsearch url paths allow dynamic values. These SHOULD be recorded in span attributes in the format
          `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`, where `<key>` is the url path part name. The implementation SHOULD
          reference the [elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json)
          in order to map the path part values to their names.
        examples:
          [
            "db.elasticsearch.path_parts.index=test-index",
            "db.elasticsearch.path_parts.doc_id=123",
          ]
