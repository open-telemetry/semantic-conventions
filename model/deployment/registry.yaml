        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Name of the [deployment environment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment)
          (aka deployment tier).
        note: |
          `deployment.environment.name` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
          the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
          This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
          considered to be identifying the same service:

          - `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=production`
          - `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=staging`.
        examples: ["staging", "production"]
      - id: deployment.target.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A unique name describing where the deployment is deploying to.
        note: This could be a fqdn of the machine or the name of the platform the deployment is deploying to.
        examples: ["test.mymachines.org", "playstore"]
      - id: deployment.target.path
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A path of where to deploy the files to on the target.
        note: This could be the same value as `process.executable.path` for an installation.
        examples: ["C:\\folder-path"]
