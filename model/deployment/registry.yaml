        brief: >
          Name of the [deployment environment](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment)
          (aka deployment tier).
        note: |
          `deployment.environment.name` does not affect the uniqueness constraints defined through
          the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id` resource attributes.
          This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
          considered to be identifying the same service:

          - `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=production`
          - `service.name=frontend`, `deployment.environment.name=staging`.
        examples: ["staging", "production"]
