      Geo fields can carry data about a specific location related to an event.
      This geolocation information can be derived from techniques such as Geo IP, or be user-supplied.

      Note: Geo attributes are typically used under another namespace, such as client.* and describe the location of the corresponding
      entity (device, end-user, etc). Semantic conventions that reference geo attributes (as a root namespace) or embed them
      (under their own namespace) SHOULD document what geo attributes describe in the scope of that convention.

    attributes:
      - id: geo.locality.name
        stability: experimental
        type: string
        brief: >
          Locality name. Represents the name of a city, town, village, or similar populated place.
