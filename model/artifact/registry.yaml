    brief: >
      This group describes attributes specific to artifacts. Artifacts are
      files or other immutable objects that are intended for distribution. This
      definition aligns directly with the
      [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model) package
      model.
    attributes:
      - id: artifact.filename
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The human readable file name of the artifact, typically generated
          during build and release processes. Often includes the package name
          and version in the file name.
        note: |
          This file name can also act as the [Package Name](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model)
          in cases where the package ecosystem maps accordingly.
          Additionally, the artifact [can be published](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#software-supply-chain)
          for others, but that is not a guarantee.
        examples:
          [
            "golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0",
            "docker-image-amd64-v0.1.0",
            "release-1.tar.gz",
            "file-name-package.tar.gz",
          ]
      - id: artifact.version
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The version of the artifact.
        examples: ["v0.1.0", "1.2.1", "122691-build"]
      - id: artifact.purl
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) of the
          [package artifact](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model)
          provides a standard way to identify and locate the packaged artifact.
        examples:
          [
            "pkg:github/package-url/purl-spec@1209109710924",
            "pkg:npm/foo@12.12.3",
          ]
      - id: artifact.hash
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          often found in checksum.txt on a release of the artifact and used to
          verify package integrity.
        note: |
          The specific algorithm used to create the cryptographic hash value is
          not defined. In situations where an artifact has multiple
          cryptographic hashes, it is up to the implementer to choose which
          hash value to set here; this should be the most secure hash algorithm
          that is suitable for the situation and consistent with the
          corresponding attestation. The implementer can then provide the other
          hash values through an additional set of attribute extensions as they
          deem necessary.
        examples:
          ["9ff4c52759e2c4ac70b7d517bc7fcdc1cda631ca0045271ddd1b192544f8a3e9"]
      - id: artifact.attestation.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The id of the build [software attestation](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model).
        examples: ["123"]
      - id: artifact.attestation.filename
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The provenance filename of the built attestation which directly
          relates to the build artifact filename. This filename SHOULD
          accompany the artifact at publish time. See the
          [SLSA Relationship](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/distributing-provenance#relationship-between-artifacts-and-attestations)
          specification for more information.
        examples:
          [
            "golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0.attestation",
            "docker-image-amd64-v0.1.0.intoto.json1",
            "release-1.tar.gz.attestation",
            "file-name-package.tar.gz.intoto.json1",
          ]
      - id: artifact.attestation.hash
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          of the built attestation. Some envelopes in the [software attestation
          space](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/main/spec) also refer to this as the **digest**.
        examples:
          ["1b31dfcd5b7f9267bf2ff47651df1cfb9147b9e4df1f335accf65b4cda498408"]
