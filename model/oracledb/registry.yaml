    brief: >
      This section defines attributes for Oracle Database.

    attributes:
      - id: oracle.db.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The database name associated with the connection.
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the parameter `DB_NAME` exposed in `v$parameter`.
        examples: ["ORCL1", "FREE"]
      - id: oracle.db.domain
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
         The database domain associated with the connection.
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the `DB_DOMAIN` initialization parameter,
          as exposed in `v$parameter`. `DB_DOMAIN` defines the domain portion of the global
          database name and SHOULD be configured when a database is, or may become, part of a
          distributed environment. Its value consists of one or more valid identifiers
          (alphanumeric ASCII characters) separated by periods.
        examples: ["example.com", "corp.internal", "prod.db.local"]
      - id: oracle.db.instance.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The instance name associated with the connection in an Oracle Real Application Clusters environment.
        note: |
          There can be multiple instances associated with a single database service. It indicates the
          unique instance name to which the connection is currently bound. For non-RAC databases, this value
          defaults to the `oracle.db.name`.
        examples: ["ORCL1", "ORCL2", "ORCL3"]
      - id: oracle.db.pdb
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The pluggable database (PDB) name associated with the connection.
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD reflect the PDB that the session is currently connected to.
          If instrumentation cannot reliably obtain the active PDB name for each operation
          without issuing an additional query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is
          RECOMMENDED to fall back to the PDB name specified at connection establishment.
        examples: ["PDB1", "FREEPDB"]
      - id: oracle.db.service
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The service name currently associated with the database connection.
        note: |
          The effective service name for a connection can change during its lifetime,
          for example after executing sql, `ALTER SESSION`. If an instrumentation cannot reliably
          obtain the current service name for each operation without issuing an additional
          query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is RECOMMENDED to fall back to the
          service name originally provided at connection establishment.
        examples: ["order-processing-service", "db_low.adb.oraclecloud.com", "db_high.adb.oraclecloud.com"]
