    brief: >
      This document defines the generic attributes that may be used in any Log Record.
    attributes:
      - id: log.record.uid
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          A unique identifier for the Log Record.
        note: >
          If an id is provided, other log records with the same id will be considered duplicates and can be removed safely.
          This means, that two distinguishable log records MUST have different values.

          The id MAY be an [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier (ULID)](https://github.com/ulid/spec),
          but other identifiers (e.g. UUID) may be used as needed.
        examples: ["01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV"]
      - id: log.record.original
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The complete original Log Record.
        note: >
          This value MAY be added when processing a Log Record which was originally transmitted as a string or equivalent data type AND
          the Body field of the Log Record does not contain the same value. (e.g. a syslog or a log record read from a file.)
        examples:
          - "77 <86>1 2015-08-06T21:58:59.694Z 192.168.2.133 inactive - - - Something happened"
          - "[INFO] 8/3/24 12:34:56 Something happened"
