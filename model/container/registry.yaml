        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Container name used by container runtime.

      - id: container.id
        type: string
        stability: alpha
        brief: >
          Container ID. Usually a UUID, as for example used to
          [identify Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/#container-identification).
          The UUID might be abbreviated.
        examples: ['a3bf90e006b2']
      - id: container.runtime.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The container runtime managing this container.
        examples: ['docker', 'containerd', 'rkt']
      - id: container.runtime.version
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The version of the runtime of this process, as returned by the runtime
          without modification.
        examples: '1.0.0'
      - id: container.runtime.description
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          A description about the runtime which could include, for example
          details about the CRI/API version being used or other customisations.
        examples: ['docker://19.3.1 - CRI: 1.22.0']
      - id: container.image.name
        type: string
        stability: alpha
        brief: >
          Name of the image the container was built on.
        examples: ['gcr.io/opentelemetry/operator']
      - id: container.image.tags
        type: string[]
        stability: alpha
        brief: >
          Container image tags. An example can be found in
          [Docker Image Inspect](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.52/#tag/Image/operation/ImageInspect).
          Should be only the `<tag>` section of the full name for example
          from `registry.example.com/my-org/my-image:<tag>`.
        examples:
          - ['v1.27.1', '3.5.7-0']
      - id: container.image.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Runtime specific image identifier. Usually a hash algorithm followed by a UUID.
        note: >
          Docker defines a sha256 of the image id; `container.image.id` corresponds to the `Image` field from the Docker
          container inspect [API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.52/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerInspect)
          endpoint.

          K8s defines a link to the container registry repository with digest `"imageID": "registry.azurecr.io
          /namespace/service/dockerfile@sha256:bdeabd40c3a8a492eaf9e8e44d0ebbb84bac7ee25ac0cf8a7159d25f62555625"`.

          The ID is assigned by the container runtime and can vary in different environments.
          Consider using `oci.manifest.digest` if it is important to identify the same
          image in different environments/runtimes.
        examples: ['sha256:19c92d0a00d1b66d897bceaa7319bee0dd38a10a851c60bcec9474aa3f01e50f']

        type: string[]
        stability: alpha
        brief: >
          Repo digests of the container image as provided by the container runtime.
        note: >
          [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.52/#tag/Image/operation/ImageInspect) and
          [CRI](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/c75ef5b473bbe2d0a4fc92f82235efd665ea8e9f/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto#L1237-L1238)

        brief: >
          The command used to run the container (i.e. the command name).
        examples: [ 'otelcontribcol' ]

        type: string[]
        stability: development
        brief: >
          All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) run by the container.

      - id: container.label
        type: template[string]
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Container labels, `<key>` being the label name, the value being the label value.
        note: >
          For example, a docker container label `app` with value `nginx` SHOULD be recorded
          as the `container.label.app` attribute with value `"nginx"`.
        examples: [ 'nginx' ]
      - id: container.csi.plugin.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The name of the CSI ([Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)) plugin used by the volume.
        note: >
          This can sometimes be referred to as a "driver" in CSI implementations.
          This should represent the `name` field of the GetPluginInfo RPC.
        examples:
          - "pd.csi.storage.gke.io"
      - id: container.csi.volume.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          The unique volume ID returned by the CSI ([Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)) plugin.
        note: >
          This can sometimes be referred to as a "volume handle" in CSI implementations.
          This should represent the `Volume.volume_id` field in CSI spec.
        examples:
          - "projects/my-gcp-project/zones/my-gcp-zone/disks/my-gcp-disk"
