          This value is intended to be taken from the
          [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface)
          (`navigator.userAgentData.platform`). If unavailable, the legacy
          `navigator.platform` API SHOULD NOT be used instead and this attribute
          SHOULD be left unset in order for the values to be consistent.

          The list of possible values is defined in the
          [W3C User-Agent Client Hints specification](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#sec-ch-ua-platform).
          Note that some (but not all) of these values can overlap with values
          in the [`os.type` and `os.name` attributes](./os.md).
          However, for consistency, the values in the `browser.platform` attribute
          should capture the exact value that the user agent provides.
        examples: ['Windows', 'macOS', 'Android']
      - id: browser.mobile
        type: boolean
        stability: development

        note: >
          Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials,
          and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example
          `https://www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d` would be sent as
          `https://www.example.com/path` by both removing any potential PII and
          reducing the cardinality of the name.
        examples: ['https://www.example.com/path', 'https://cdn.example.com/styles/main.css']
