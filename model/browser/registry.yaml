          This value is intended to be taken from the
          [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface)
          (`navigator.userAgentData.platform`). If unavailable, the legacy
          `navigator.platform` API SHOULD NOT be used instead and this attribute
          SHOULD be left unset in order for the values to be consistent.

          The list of possible values is defined in the
          [W3C User-Agent Client Hints specification](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#sec-ch-ua-platform).
          Note that some (but not all) of these values can overlap with values
          in the [`os.type` and `os.name` attributes](./os.md).
          However, for consistency, the values in the `browser.platform` attribute
          should capture the exact value that the user agent provides.
        examples: ['Windows', 'macOS', 'Android']
      - id: browser.mobile
        type: boolean
        stability: development
        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the browser is running on a mobile device'
