    name: browser.page_view
    brief: >
      This event represents a browser page load/view.
    note: >
      The primary use case is to capture metrics about the number of views of
      a page. Page view can be a hard page load in a browser as well as virtual
      navigation in a SPA (single-page application). The event should be
      collected as soon as possible without waiting for potentially delayed
      data such as the Navigation timing browser API.
