    type: event
    name: browser.resource_timing
    brief: >
      This event describes the timing metrics as provided by PerformanceResourceTiming Performance API.
      These metrics are related to fetching a resource, such as
      XMLHttpRequest, Fetch, sendBeacon APIs, SVG, image or script.
    note: >
      This event captures data from the [ResourceTiming](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).
      It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceResourceTiming API.
      If the page starts unloading before the page loads,
      then the partial data can be captured by calling the [performance.getEntriesByType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) method.

      fields:
        - id: url
          type: string
          stability: development
          brief: The full URL of the resource being fetched.
          requirement_level: required
          examples: ["https://www.example.com/path", "//localhost"]
          note: >
            This is the URL of the resource being measured, not the page URL.
            Generally the url doesn't include any query strings or any leading credentials,
            and it's formatted as scheme://full domain/path only, for example https://www.example.com/path?a=b&c=d
            would be sent as https://www.example.com/path by both removing any potential PII and reducing the cardinality of the name.
