          A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device
        note: |
          Its value MUST remain the same between launches of the same installation of an application.
          On a particular device it MIGHT be the same across different applications of the same vendor, however, it MUST be different across applications of different vendors.
          It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the installation identifier.
          The `installation.id` SHOULD be prefixed with the type of the identifier and a colon separator (e.g. `firebase:`).

          On iOS this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

          On Android this value SHOULD be equal to either:

          - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
          - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.

          But it MAY be equal to other identifiers such as:

          - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
          - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

          More information about Android identifier best practices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).
