                On Linux, this corresponds to "MemTotal - MemAvailable" from /proc/meminfo, which
                more accurately reflects memory in active use by applications compared to older
                formulas based on free, cached, and buffers. If MemAvailable is not available,
                a fallback to those older formulas may be used.

                tasks are stalled on a given resource simultaneously. This represents
                a state where actual CPU cycles are going to waste and the workload
                is thrashing. CPU full is undefined at the system level and is set to
                zero for backward compatibility (available since Linux 5.13).
