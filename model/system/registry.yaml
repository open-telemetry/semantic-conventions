                On Linux, this corresponds to "MemTotal - MemAvailable" from /proc/meminfo, which
                more accurately reflects memory in active use by applications compared to older
                formulas based on free, cached, and buffers. If MemAvailable is not available,
                a fallback to those older formulas may be used.
