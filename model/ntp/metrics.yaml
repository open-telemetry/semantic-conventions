    brief: The frequency is the rate by which the system s clock would be wrong if chronyd was not correcting it.
    note: >
      It is expressed in ppm (parts per million).
      For example, a value of 1 ppm would mean that when the systemâ€™s clock thinks it has advanced 1 second, it has actually advanced by 1.000001 seconds relative to true time.
