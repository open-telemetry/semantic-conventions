        The web browser in which the application represented by the resource is running.
        The `browser.*` attributes MUST be used only for resources that represent applications
        running in a web browser (regardless of whether running on a mobile or desktop device).
    attributes:
      - ref: browser.brands
      - ref: browser.platform
      - ref: browser.mobile
      - ref: browser.language
      - ref: user_agent.original
        brief: 'Full user-agent string provided by the browser'
        note: >
          The user-agent value SHOULD be provided only from browsers that do not have a mechanism
          to retrieve brands and platform individually from the User-Agent Client Hints API.
          To retrieve the value, the legacy `navigator.userAgent` API can be used.
