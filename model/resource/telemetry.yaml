          The name of the telemetry SDK as defined above.
        note: |
          The OpenTelemetry SDK MUST set the `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to `opentelemetry`.
          If another SDK, like a fork or a vendor-provided implementation, is used, this SDK MUST set the
          `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to the fully-qualified class or module name of this SDK's main entry point
          or another suitable identifier depending on the language.
          The identifier `opentelemetry` is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this case.
          All custom identifiers SHOULD be stable across different versions of an implementation.
