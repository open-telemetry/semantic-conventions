        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        note: >
            Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message.
            When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD
            use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.
        examples: [0, 1, 2]
      - id: messaging.client.id

        brief: >
          The name of the consumer group with which a consumer is associated.
        note: >
          Semantic conventions for individual messaging systems SHOULD document whether `messaging.consumer.group.name`
          is applicable and what it means in the context of that system.
        examples: ['my-group', 'indexer']
      - id: messaging.destination.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: 'The message destination name'
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']

          Semantic conventions for individual messaging systems SHOULD document whether `messaging.destination.subscription.name`
          is applicable and what it means in the context of that system.

        brief: Low cardinality representation of the messaging destination name
        note: >
          Destination names could be constructed from templates.
          An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id.
          Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality,
          the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively
          used for grouping and aggregation.
        examples: ['/customers/{customerId}']
      - id: messaging.destination.anonymous
        type: boolean

        brief: 'A boolean that is true if the message destination is anonymous (could be unnamed or have auto-generated name).'
