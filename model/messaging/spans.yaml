          In RabbitMQ, the destination is defined by an *exchange*, a *routing key* and for consumers, a *queue*.

          `messaging.destination.name` SHOULD be set to:

          - **On the producer side**: `{exchange}:{routing key}` when both values are present and non-empty.
          When only one is available, only that value SHOULD be used. E.g., `{exchange}` or `{routing key}`.
          Otherwise: `amq.default` when the default exchange is used and no routing key is provided

          - **On the consumer side**: `{exchange}:{routing key}:{queue}` when all values are present and non-empty.
          If any has an empty value (e.g., the default exchange is used) it SHOULD be omitted.
          For cases when `{routing key}` and `{queue}` are equal, only one of them SHOULD
          be used, e.g., `{exchange}:{routing key}`.
