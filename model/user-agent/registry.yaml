          a user-agent for non-browser products, such as microservices with multiple names/versions inside the
          `user_agent.original`, the most significant name SHOULD be selected. In such a scenario it should align with
          `user_agent.version`

         Specifies the category of synthetic traffic, such as tests or bots.
        note: >
          This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute.
          Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic.
          This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result
          of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.
