groups:
  - id: registry.source
    type: attribute_group
    display_name: Source Attributes
    brief: >
      These attributes may be used to describe the sender of a network exchange/packet. These should be used
      when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown.
      This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if
      there was a connection or which side initiated it.
      This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the
      "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.
    attributes:
      - id: source.address
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: "Source address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name."
        note: >
          When observed from the destination side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `source.address` SHOULD represent
          the source address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
        examples: ['source.example.com', '10.1.2.80', '/tmp/my.sock']
      - id: source.port
        type: int
        stability: development
        brief: 'Source port number'
        examples: [3389, 2888]
      - id: source.interface.id
        stability: development
        type: int
        brief: Source Interface Id
        note: Interface ID as reported by an observer (typically SNMP interface ID).
        examples: [10]
      - id: source.interface.name
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: Source Interface Name
        note: Interface name as reported by the system.
        examples: ["eth0"]
      - id: source.mac
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: Source mac address
        note: >
          MAC Addresses MUST be represented in [IEEE RA hexadecimal form](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf):
          as hyphen-separated octets in uppercase hexadecimal form from most to least significant.
        examples: ['AC-DE-48-23-45-67', 'AC-DE-48-23-45-67-01-9F']
      - id: source.zone
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: Zone where traffic can be categorized as coming from
        note: Network zone of incoming traffic as reported by an observer to categorize the source area of the traffic.
        examples: ["internal", "External", "DMZ", "HR", "Legal"]
      - id: source.vlan.id
        stability: development
        type: int
        brief: Source VLAN Id
        note: VLAN ID as reported by the observer.
        examples: [10]
      - id: source.vlan.name
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: Source VLAN Name
        note: VLAN name as reported by the observer.
        examples: ["outside", "DMZ", "corporate"]
