        note: >
          Instrumentations SHOULD use error code such as one of errors reported by
          `getaddrinfo`([Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html) /
          [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-getaddrinfo)) or one reported by the
          runtime or client library.
          If error code is not available, the full name of exception type SHOULD be used.
        examples: ["host_not_found", "no_recovery", "java.net.UnknownHostException"]
