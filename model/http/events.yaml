    stability: development
    type: event
    brief: >
      This event represents an exception that occurred during an HTTP client request,
      such as network failures, timeouts, or other errors that prevent the request
      from completing successfully.
    note: >
      This event SHOULD be recorded when an exception occurs during HTTP client operations.

      Instrumentations SHOULD set the severity to WARN (severity number 13) when recording this event.

      Some HTTP client frameworks generate artificial exceptions for non-successful HTTP status codes
      (e.g., 404 Not Found). When possible, instrumentations SHOULD NOT record these artificial
      exceptions, or SHOULD set the severity to DEBUG (severity number 5).

      Instrumentations MAY provide a configuration option to populate exception events
      with the attributes captured on the corresponding HTTP client span.
    attributes:
      - ref: exception.type
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: Required if `exception.message` is not set, recommended otherwise.
      - ref: exception.message
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: Required if `exception.type` is not set, recommended otherwise.

      This event represents an exception that occurred during HTTP server request processing,

      the server from successfully handling the request.
