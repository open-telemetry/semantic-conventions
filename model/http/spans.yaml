    brief: >
      This span represents an outbound HTTP request.
    note: |
      There are two ways HTTP client spans can be implemented in an instrumentation:

      1. Instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt to send an HTTP request over the wire.
         In case the request is resent, the resend attempts MUST follow the [HTTP resend spec](#http-request-retries-and-redirects).
         In this case, instrumentations SHOULD NOT (also) emit a logical encompassing HTTP client span.

      2. If for some reason it is not possible to emit a span for each send attempt (because e.g. the instrumented library does not expose hooks that would allow this),
         instrumentations MAY create an HTTP span for the top-most operation of the HTTP client.
         In this case, the `url.full` MUST be the absolute URL that was originally requested, before any HTTP-redirects that may happen when executing the request.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status:** refer to the [Span Status](/docs/http/http-spans.md#status) section.
