    brief: >
      This span represents AWS Lambda invocation.
    note: |
      Consider setting other attributes of the [`faas` resource][faasres] and [trace][faas] conventions
      and the [cloud resource conventions][cloud].

      **Span name** MUST be set to the function name from the Lambda `Context`
      unless stated otherwise.

      **Span kind** MUST be set to `SERVER` unless stated otherwise.

        brief: The value of the AWS Request ID, which is always available through an accessor on the Lambda Context.
      - ref: cloud.account.id
        brief: >
          In some languages, this is available as an accessor on the Lambda Context. Otherwise, it can be parsed from the ARN as the fifth item when splitting on ':'.
      - ref: cloud.resource_id
        brief: >
          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource
          e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS.
        note: >
          The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
          Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
          [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
          with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
          multiple different aliases.
        examples:
          - 'arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function'
