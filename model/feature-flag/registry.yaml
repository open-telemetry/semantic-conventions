        This document defines attributes for Feature Flags.
    attributes:
      - id: feature_flag.key
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: The unique identifier of the feature flag.
        examples: ["logo-color"]
      - id: feature_flag.provider.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: The name of the service provider that performs the flag evaluation.
        examples: ["Flag Manager"]
      - id: feature_flag.variant
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["red", "true", "on"]
        brief: >
          SHOULD be a semantic identifier for a value. If one is unavailable, a
          stringified version of the value can be used.
        note: |-
          A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
          for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
          provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
          For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

          A stringified version of the value can be used in situations where a
          semantic identifier is unavailable. String representation of the value
          should be determined by the implementer.
      - id: feature_flag.value
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["#ff0000", "1", "true"]
        brief: >
          The evaluated value of the feature flag.
      - id: feature_flag.context.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["5157782b-2203-4c80-a857-dbbd5e7761db"]
        brief: >
          The unique identifier for the flag evaluation context. For example, the targeting key.
      - id: feature_flag.version
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["1", "01ABCDEF"]
        brief: >
          The version of the ruleset used during the evaluation. Could use a hash if a version is not available.
      - id: feature_flag.environment.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["proj-1", "ab98sgs"]
        brief: >
          The identifier of the environment which the feature flag belongs to in a flag management system.
