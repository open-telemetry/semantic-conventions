    brief: >
        This document defines attributes for Feature Flags.
    attributes:
      - id: feature_flag.key
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: The lookup key of the feature flag.
        examples: ["logo-color"]
      - id: feature_flag.provider.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: Any string which identifies the feature flag provider being used such as its name.
        examples: ["Flag Manager"]
      - id: feature_flag.variant
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["red", "true", "on"]
        brief: >
          A semantic identifier for an evaluated flag value.
        note: |-
          A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
          for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
          provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
          For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.
      - id: feature_flag.value
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["#ff0000", "1", "true"]
        brief: >
          The evaluated value of the feature flag.
      - id: feature_flag.context.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["5157782b-2203-4c80-a857-dbbd5e7761db"]
        brief: >
          The unique identifier for the flag evaluation context. For example, the targeting key.
      - id: feature_flag.version
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["1", "01ABCDEF"]
        brief: >
          The version of the ruleset used during the evaluation. This may be any stable value which uniquely identifies the ruleset.
      - id: feature_flag.set.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        examples: ["proj-1", "ab98sgs", "service1/dev"]
        brief: >
          The identifier of the [flag set](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary/#flag-set) which the feature flag belongs to in a flag management system.
