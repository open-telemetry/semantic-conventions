    brief: >
      This semantic convention defines the attributes used to represent a
      feature flag evaluation as an event.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag
      value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an
      application lifecycle.
      For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a
      flag each time a button is clicked.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

              If and only if feature flag provider does not supply variant or equivalent concept.
              Otherwise, `value` should be treated as opt-in.
