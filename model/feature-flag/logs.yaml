    brief: >
      Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.
    note: >
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag
      value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an
      application lifecycle.
      For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a
      flag each time a button is clicked.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

          | `targeting_key_missing` | The provider requires a targeting key and one was not provided in the evaluation context. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
          | `type_mismatch` | The type of the flag value does not match the expected type. | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
