    brief: >
      This semantic convention defines the attributes used to represent a
      feature flag evaluation as an event.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag
      value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an
      application lifecycle.
      For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a
      flag each time a button is clicked.
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.
    attributes:
      - ref: feature_flag.key
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: feature_flag.variant
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If feature flag provider supplies a variant or equivalent concept.
      - ref: feature_flag.system
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: feature_flag.context.id
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: feature_flag.version
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: feature_flag.set.id
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: feature_flag.value
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: >
            If and only if feature flag provider does not supply variant or equivalent concept.
            Otherwise, `feature_flag.value` should be treated as opt-in.
