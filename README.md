Semantic Conventions define a common set of (semantic) attributes which
provide meaning to data when collecting, producing and consuming it.

## Read the docs

The human-readable version of the semantic conventions resides in the [docs](docs/README.md) folder.
Major parts of these Markdown documents are generated from the YAML definitions located in the [model](model/README.md) folder.

## Roadmap

For an overview of the current focus areas and active initiatives
the Semantic Conventions project is committed to, check out the
[OpenTelemetry Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/158/views/1?filterQuery=sig%3A%22Semantic+Conventions%3A+*%22).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to limited maintainer and reviewer bandwidth, priority is given to initiatives
> listed in the roadmap. Contributions outside these areas may be delayed or
> not accepted unless they are formally added to the roadmap through the
> established project proposal process.
