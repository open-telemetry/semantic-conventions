  Fix telemetry for complex queries:

  - introduce the `db.query.summary` attribute to provide a concise, low-cardinality
    representation of the query text.
  - use `db.query.summary` as the span name and as a recommended attribute on metrics.
  - avoid capturing `db.operation.name` and `db.collection.name` when the query
    involves multiple operations or collections, to prevent ambiguity.
