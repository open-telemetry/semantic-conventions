  The `graphql.document` attribute contains user-inputted data that is often sensitive,
  potentially unbounded in length, and high-cardinality. Moving from Recommended to Opt-In
  ensures operators make an informed decision before enabling this attribute.
  Also updated the note to use SHOULD for stronger normative language regarding sanitization.
