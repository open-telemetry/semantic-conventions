  This is a breaking change from the schema perspective, but does not change anything for instrumentations
  or the end users.
  It breaks compatibility with the (old) [code generation tooling](https://github.com/open-telemetry/build-tools/issues/322).
  Please use [weaver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver) to generate Semantic Conventions markdown or code.
