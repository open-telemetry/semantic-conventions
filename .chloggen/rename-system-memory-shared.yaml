subtext:
  The `system.memory.shared` metric has been renamed to `system.memory.linux.shared` to
  align with other Linux-specific memory metrics (`system.memory.linux.available` and
  `system.memory.linux.slab.usage`). This metric reports shared memory used, primarily
  by tmpfs, and is only available on Linux systems.
